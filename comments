"i started it in march after a long string of unsuccessful medications: stelara, remicade, xeljanz, entyvio, and omvoh. plus loads of prednisone. this is my last option pretty much.

i'm not kidding that within 3 days i went from 15 bloody bms to 2 with no blood. now i'm down to 1 normal per day and feel like my old self. 

no side effects beyond acne when i started at 45mg. that went away when i dropped to 30mg and tbh it was just a few scattered zits. they were more xystic painful though, just not a lot. gave me an excuse to buy more skincare and makeup lol."
"reduced symptoms immediately after starting. iâ€™m a month in and still experiencing some symptoms, but itâ€™s all much more manageable than before. 

iâ€™ve had acne along my hairline, shoulders and upper back. it all seems to be clearing up now. besides that, iâ€™ve struck a routine where i experience relentless flatulence starting around 5am. only a few bms per day (i have a high metabolism, 3 bms would be normal for me), but the farting is a constant. suppose iâ€™m thankful i can fart fearlessly?"
"upa is so good, back to myself within weeks, i even managed 2 months steroid free! unfortunately my disease was too advance and it crept back up on me.

only side effect i noticed was high bp, which was counteracted with ramipril.

really hope it works for you ðŸ™"
"jak-ne (jak inhibitor related acne) as already mentioned.  typically cystic and painful.  muscle cramping.  those were worth it because it worked so well and so fast on my uc.  it really felt like full remission really quickly.

  
the bad news was my liver wasn't having it.  i had very elevated liver enzymes and developed fatty liver.  i was taken off it and after 8-10 weeks, went back to being pretty normal, liver wise."
i used to take rinvoq for 9 weeks and i failed. i got bad ass acne (hurts like hell) and lost a lotttt of hair! but i hope it helps you!
this has eased my mind :) i hope this is my wonder drug after all then as like you, i've failed everything else :/ glad to know the acne isn't that bad either. i did get a bit of acne due to the vedo which sounds the same as you've just described so i'm at ease now!
similar thing happened to me with vedolizumab (entyvio) 12 weeks later my liver still isn't right
can you tell me about your muscle cramps?  my son started rinvoq a few days ago and it has already helped his uc but he is complaining of muscle cramps in his leg.  reading about blood clots has me paranoid.  thanks!
"sure! so let me first put your mind at ease, it wasn't clot related. rinvoq actually has a lower incidence of clotting than xeljans, although it's still not zero. i'd really only be worried about it if you have a family history of clotting problems.

my cramping was mostly in my neck and back. it got progressively worse as i was on the drug and it felt like the worst cramping. like i was always super stressed and dehydrated. i also had deep, cystic acne on my face, head, chest and shoulders. it was deep, painful, and never really got a head on it. after a lot of tests including an ultrasound and a liver biopsy (0/10, do not recommend), it was determined those symptoms along with highly elevated liver enzymes were being caused my rinvoq. i couldn't metabolize the drug fully and the result was waste products were ending up in muscles and skin, hence the acne and cramping. i switched to zeposia and all symptoms went away in 6-8 weeks. 

all that said: don't panic. your boy probably just had a cramp from not drinking enough water. but definitely keep an eye open. make sure he gets a blood panel every six months to make sure he's doing well. if the cramping gets more consistent or you notice an uptick in acne, get on the gastro's calendar. it's not cause for alarm or time to freak out, it's just a sign that rinvoq isn't working right and it's time to look at other options. there are lots of drugs out there now for uc and you just need to find the one that's right for you."
thank you for sharing your experience!
"for me rinvoq has been amazing. just hit a month on it and saw improvement within the first week. pain went away within a couple days, bowel movements normalized within about a week, and hunger and energy came back around then as well. honestly it's hard to over state how awesome it has been for me.

the most exciting thing about it, at least for me, is it's very effective for people like me who have failed all the biologics."
been on rinvoq for 2 weeks now. i been in a really bad flare for a year. constant stomach pain a diarrhea all day, every day, for 365 daysâ€¦. rinvoq has literally changed my life. just 2 or 3 days after starting most of my symptoms are gone. in the mornings i still have some pain and diarrhea but i can finally leave my house a be a normal controbuting member of society. best of luck op!
"iâ€™ve been on rinvoq since august.
so c-diff basically destroyed my colon, took some study meds but they didnâ€™t work and then started with rinvoq.
after a few days i already noticed some improvements. doctor said it fast working and you could see results after 2 weeks.
had a sigmoidoscopy last week at 8 weeks and my colon had improved, but inflammation is still very present.

a bunch of meds didnâ€™t work for me, but this one seems to work somewhat. 
side effects iâ€™m having is some light acne (doctor mentioned this) and i had to start blood thinners because my platelets became to high due to the meds."
i was on rinvoq. i started at 45mg. it stopped my period and gave me horrible scalp acne. when they lowered the dose to 30mg, my period came back but very light.
i was in a flare for 2 years and failed to respond to 6mp, remicade and entyvio even at elevated doses. started rivoq about 2-3 months ago now i'm back down to 80 calprotectin . some symptoms remain like a bit of urgency and loose moments but overall sooo much better. im hoping these will go away in time \^
worked really well for me for about two months and now not so well, but i have an ileostomy with pyoderma and perianal crohnâ€™s so not a normal case. no issues with side effects. really hope it works for you!
"i started rinvoq on 9/11. i noticed improvements after 8 days. prior to that i was going to the bathroom 3 or 4 times a day sometimes more with fierce urgency and it was all liquid.  that went on for at least 3 months or longer. so at day 8 i was doing so much better and thankful.

i'm on 45mg, i'll be on this dose until about 12/4 and then stepping down to a lower dose. 

i previously had success with remicade and humira. 

so far so good, thankfully!"
itâ€™s working well for me so far and iâ€™ve failed humira and stelara. as long as things keep going the way they are, iâ€™m happy.

this makes me really hopeful, thank you so much for sharing!
thatâ€™s so brilliant to read! iâ€™ve failed so many biologicals so i was really nervous about this one.
so sorry to hear about your awful flare, very happy to hear rinvoq has been working for you!! thank you so much!
thank you for sharing your experience!
thanks for sharing, i hope the side effects will subside for you
thank you for sharing and happy to hear you are feeling much better!
sorry to hear about your complicated case, thank you for sharing and for your well-wishes!
happy to hear it's working for you! thanks for sharing ðŸ’œ
happy to hear, thanks for sharing!
jak inhibitors are a step in the right direction, especially the more targeted ones. the challenge is that their entire profile suppresses the immune system and, therefore, presents the possibility of the development of malignancies and other things. again, the science is marching toward better treatment options and we should be happy about that. however, if the black box warning lists cancer as a possible side effect, i'm happy to keep my vitiligo. some risk? sign me up. major risks? nah i'm good.
yeah im not sure oral jak inhibitors will ever be a real solution, happy to stick with topicals though
sus
"i have been on rinvoq upadacitinib (45mg) for 10 months now after mtx, humira, simponi, etanercept and jyseleca (filgotinib) didn't work properly or only for short time.

from what i've heard, rituximab is more intense as it wipes out your b-cells (please correct if wrong) so you will be very prone to infections. upadacitinib is more on the same infection risk level as the other biologics.

rinvoq has been really great, only downside is weight gain and acne but being almost pain-free is a good trade-off."
"i'm going into biologic #3, and unfortunately it's more common than you'd think. but it's not as scary, either!

when the first one failed it really threw me for a loop. i had already ""failed"" mtx. when enbrel stopped working i thought i was doomed. i brought this up at my appt, and my rheumy wrote out a chart with all the possibilities. there are so many bios on the market. according to [the arthritis foundation ](https://www.arthritis.org/drug-guide/biologics/biologics), there are 5 types: ""tumor necrosis factor-Î± (tnf) inhibitors, b-cell inhibitors, interleukin inhibitors, selective co-stimulation modulators, and monoclonal antibodies"". each category has different options, too! 

plus, treatment plans are all about the combos. in my last appt, my new rheumy told me that developing an effective treatment plan is nothing but trial and error. that's very disconcerting, but imagine having ra 25 years ago when there weren't any biologics! 

don't worry too much; mental/emotional stress can make you flare-y. as difficult as things are atm, you're moving forward to find what works ðŸ€"
my mother started taking upadacitinib now. she started with mtx got bad lung infection then tried sulfasalazine with prednisolone (did not work at all), then one more treatment i forgot about. now she is taking upadacitinib for one month. she started feeling better after 1 week but she is taking prednisolone with it.
thank you all for the replies ðŸ¥° i decided to go for updacitinib for now ðŸ§šðŸ¼â€â™€ï¸
"iâ€™m on filgotinib (jyseleca) which, similarly to rinvoq is a selective jak inhibitor. it was also the first med in many years that finally put me in remission.
iâ€™ve not had any infections or otherwise since i started in october, so canâ€™t relate there. with that said, you may want to speak with your doctor about your illnesses and see if there is something to be done. likely little to do except stop the med though. if thatâ€™s the case youâ€™ll have to determine whether the possible return to flaring is worth the infections. to further muddy this choice is that you have likely been on most treatments already without success. iâ€™m guessing youâ€™ve been on the various types of biologics and now a jak inhibitor. how about s1p antagonists like ozanimod or estramod? 

 if no med works, and you donâ€™t want to deal with the infections then perhaps look into surgery? 

only you can determine whatâ€™s right for you. 

also just a short note, rinvoq is not a biologic. biologics are produced from living organisms, are liquid so taken by infusion or injection and the drug name with end in -mab. i mention this because it might avoid some confusion when discussing with your gi."
"what were those 4 infections? and how old are you? 

what does feeling slightly unwell mean? like feverish or tired or drowsy? have you checked you vitamin and haemoglobin levels?"
did you try 15mg first? it can be prescribed at 15mg. it might be worth asking your doctor about stepping down to 15mg. that would suppress your immune system less, making you less susceptible to infections but more susceptible to a flare.  sounds like it might be worth it in your case. the manufacturer does recommend to "use the lowest effective dose needed to maintain response".
"i am becoming more and more ok with the idea of surgery. on top of that the thought of being on immunosuppressants for the rest of my life (i'm 24) sounds grim. if it's likely i'll need to get my colon removed one day i might aswell just do it now...that's what i'm thinking anyway. 

there are still a few more biologics to try but i don't even know if i want to anymore ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ id happily try reducing the dose but i'm running out of willpower to try treatments."
"24 years old. i had c.diff, covid and 2 other colds on separate occasions (one currently)

feeling unwell, meaning feverish and fatigued. my haemo levels are fine but not checked my vit levels.."
not tried 15mg. i started on 45, then moved down to and stayed on 30. this is a great idea, i'll definitely be asking to try 15 and see if i can start to feel better. i can't lie, if i had to choose between flaring up or feeling unwell all the time.....i think i'd prefer flaring up â˜ ï¸ i can deal with pain but the fatigue and fever makes me not want to do anything ever
yeah thatâ€™s not an uncommon path either, and much down to personal preference. i prefer exhausting all medications before surgery, but can definitely see the appeal of just getting it over with. read up on the surgery and talk with your gi about it. best of luck!
did your infections cause a flare?
great advice, i will be doing exactly that, thankyou;))
surprisingly no, the flare that was under control in feb has pretty much stayed in control until now even with all the infections
thatâ€™s nice! i was on my first remission since ever on rinvoq and then got covid. 3 days later i was on the verge of getting hospitalised again. now on 60mg of prednisone hoping for the best. i wanna eat shawarama though but red meat is too much to digest rn ðŸ¤£
ahaha ikwym! one of the good things about being in hospital on iv steroids is i basically eat whatever i want without consequence â˜ ï¸  so there's that!
it's been a wonder drug for a lot of us here. works quickly, and it's very effective. main side effect is acne during the loading dose, but that goes away during the maintenance phase.
rinvoq! has a pretty good track record for a lot of people. like antimodez said, acne during the loading doses was the only issue i had.

messaged you from another account please send me a direct message
currently on and had questions for sure due to potential side effects and some family history but consulted with my doctor and another specialist and have been on for a few months with a biologic combo (have also had other several other drugs fail or lose effect over time). my biggest side effect has been the hair follicle inflammation (and some acne). recent bloodwork also showed an increase in my cholesterol (a known side effect) but i am still within normal parameters. definitely discuss your concerns with your doctor and ensure they'll be monitoring bloodwork, etc.
i recommend searching the sub. thereâ€™s been plenty of posts about it recently.
been on it for awhile. it works insanely quickly which is nice. pretty much as quick as steroids like prednisone. during the induction period i had some acne which seems to be a very common side effect. after going down to 30 no more acne and no other side effects.
hi, one question is wether you want to have more freedom from iv (infliximab) to an oral treatment (upadacitinib/rinvoq) directly or have an intermediate alternative as rinvoq is mainly recommended to patients that have not well been controlled on tnfa blockers (like infliximab). 8 years is a good period of efficacy on infliximab so you might want to ask for alternative treatments like entyvio, stelara or skyrizi (iv or/and subcutaneous pending on brand) as those have proven data if you feel not ready for rinvoq yet. ask your gastro about comparative side effects profiles of all 4 brands so you are able to take the right decision for what makes sense to you on top of medical advice. wish you all the best!

i have been on rinvoq since april. iâ€™m allergic to an inactive ingredient thatâ€™s in all biologics. itâ€™s worked well for me. worst part is iâ€™ve been sick with a lot of viruses. i never was sick before but iâ€™m sick now and this is the 5th time since i started. other side effects are terrible acne, but after a few months and with the help of a dermatologist my skin is completely clear now. also a lot of people gain weight. i gained weight for the first few months and had previously gained weight from being on steroids. iâ€™ve been on a weight-loss program through my insurance and have been losing 1lb a week since the end of november. and finally, the best part, it has worked really well for controlling my crohnâ€™s. iâ€™ve had a couple of small flares but otherwise feel great in that area.
make sure you have gotten the hpv vaccination.  because rinvoq will stop your body clearing it. i am dealing with severe consequences because of this.
yes â€¦.. so far so goodâ€¦. raised my cholesterol but taking red yeast rice to try to help that
hi, how severe has your acne been? i'm expecting to start the treatment but i'm anxious
were you on anything before this?
yes. to be on rinvoq you have to have at least failed one tnf-alpha inhibitor (humira or remicade). you name a medication for crohn's and i've been on it since i've had the disease since being a little kid prior to biologics coming out.
ah i wasnâ€™t aware of that. i havenâ€™t heard much of rinvoq until recently. iâ€™ve been on humira for almost a year now and itâ€™s not really helping much anymore so my doctors are trying to switch me to rinvoq since theyâ€™ve had good results with it. just a little nervous for the acne part, but i hope it all works out. how is your crohns now?
"crohn's is good. the big things i've noticed about rinvoq are:  
1) the acne was there on 45mg loading dose, but it went away when i moved to 30mg maintenance dose.  
2) seemed to take awhile to adjust to the 30mg. after going down i was having a lot more symptoms though over the next 3-4 months they just slowly became less and less frequent. these days i have a day of symptoms maybe once every two weeks and its still continuing to be less frequent."
how long were you on the loading dose for? or is it different for everybody? sorry for all the questions. when you say you were having a lot more symptoms when dropping down to 30mg, was it like before you started the medicine or it was an improvement? sorry if that doesnâ€™t make sense.
"everyone is on the loading dose for 90 days. 

it was like before i started the meds. then over time i got to the point where i'm at now where i don't have any pain or symptoms except for maybe 1 day out of every 2 weeks. that rate is also increasing so hopefully it'll be 1 day every month soon."
these sound more like flare symptoms than rinvoq side effects. the puffy eye things is a possible crohns side effect, same with everything else you've mentioned. imo, doctor time again. may need to mix things up.

could be as simple as a taper dose of prednisone
"hear hear! do not come to the internet to ask questions about your medicine because we are not doctors. 

that being said i take 30mg of rinvoq and it seems to be doing an alright job at controlling or lessening the intensity of my symptoms but mileage may vary"
[removed]
my, arenâ€™t you charming!
"i just got bumped from 30mg to 45mg.
no improvements after 15 days. going to the hospital this evening and see what they have up their sleeves. never heard of 60mg of rinvoq."
i haven't heard of this. since it looks like remicade isn't working for me my doctor is really pushing me to do a research study combining rinvoq and entyvio. i am a mayo clinic 3 score. very severe. are you severe?
yeah iâ€™m mayo clinic 3 as well. i tried remicade wasnâ€™t working then they gave me a double dose of it every 4 weeks instead of normal dose every 8 weeks and it didnâ€™t work.
iâ€™m not sure you can combine biologics with rinvoq
my new gi specializes in ibd and they always have trials going on. it's a new trial. guess we'll find out lol. i was feeling good for almost 2 months and now i'm quickly getting worse. i'm willing to try almost anything. almost.
hahaha i feel you thatâ€™s me right now. doctors are saying i have to get better asap otherwise surgery time. hell no iâ€™m not doing surgery.
i got told the same thing on thursday morning by my gi. but my inflammation markers went down yesterday, thankfully, so i may be improving.
likewise my inflammation markers have dropped from 39 to 20. hopefully they keep coming down

started on rinvoq late last year, and it has been a game changer. all pain and inflammation has gone, it's like i don't have as anymore. (31m).
yes, and i did not do well.  i started with injections of humira every two weeks, but it stopped working, so i was switched to rinvoq.  i tried, but after two months, it just was not doing anything at all, and my peripheral symptoms and fatigue were just off the charts.  it wasn't good, and i felt like trash.  i am on weekly injections of enbrel now, rarely need nsaids for pain, and my fatigue is 80% improved.  tnf inhibitors seem to work well for me.  jak inhibitors, not so much :(
i was on rinvoq after being unable to tolerate humira or enbrel. in my experience it didnâ€™t help, even paired with hydroxychloroquine. taltz, an il-17 inhibitor has worked much better for me until winter hit, now itâ€™s been rough again.
"wow! that's good to hear - obviously hoping this is my case too, but i'm trying not to be too optimistic ðŸ˜‚
glad you're feeling much better!"
"thank you for your reply.
that's good to know: i will ask the rheumatologist about tnf inhibitors if these do not work.

i'm glad you found something that worked ðŸ™‚ i'm on rinvoq for at least two months, and it's only day 3, so a while before i will be reviewed again. i've had no side effects so far though so that's always good haha."
"thank you! i'll keep a note of that too if rinvoq doesn't seem to help.

i've actually seen a small improvement. i'm on crutches at the moment and if i stood for a few minutes, even with my crutches, my legs would spasm and i would be unable to move.

i'm still on crutches but i'm able to stand for a little bit longer, and when i sit in a chair for an hour i no longer get locked into position.

hopefully it continues to work, but i think a few people see improvements and then it stops working.

i'm sorry to hear you had a bad winter, i do hope you see an improvement soon."
keeping a symptom journal is a good idea while youâ€™re testing out new meds. just something really simple, even a log in your notes app. try to see if you have more good days than bad. fingers crossed that you keep seeing more improvement!
that's a question for a pharmacist. cyp3 is an extremely common pathway. grapefruit for instance uses it as does qing dai and a bunch of other things.
"the good news for you is that for the most part, you really donâ€™t need to worry about messing up as you arenâ€™t writing your own prescriptions. your doctor along with your pharmacist will ensure youâ€™re not taking an inappropriate combination. this just leaves otcs to be concerned about. when in doubt, consult dr google before trying, but hereâ€™s a good summary
- avoid ppis (omeprazole, pantoprazole, anything with -prazole suffix)
- avoid st. johnâ€™s wort
- avoid grapefruit juice

for as needed otc pain relief, tylenol is probably your best option, but try to not drink heavily. 

other drug classes for concern with cyp3a4 include certain psychiatric medications (like antidepressants), some blood pressure meds, and some antifungals. again, you donâ€™t really have to worry about messing up here as these are prescription only."
acetylsalicilic acid is aspirin. nsaids are ibuprofen, advil, aleve. hereâ€™s a list of the inhibitors: https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image?imagekey=card/76992

"i had it during the first part of the loading dose (45mg). it ended up going away on its own by the end of the loading dose.

luckily my wife works in oncology so helped reassure me that my level while below the normal threshold didn't worry her unless it kept going down. my gi and ibd pharmacist were definitely more concerned though since they don't see those values everyday like she does."

wouldn't it have been easier to type "rinvoq"?  save people a trip to google.

"lol yes i was about to do that.

i tried rinvoq and it didn't do anything for me.  it has helped people here though.  there are many posts about it.

i seem to only respond to anti tnf meds like humira or cimzia.  but rinvoq may work great for you.  try it if you are able to."
"since others have already weighed inâ€¦hereâ€™s a completely random reason to choose dupixent:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34737108/

results: the dupilumab-treated group showed reduced incidence and severity of covid-19 symptoms versus other treatment groups. dupilumab-treated patients were less likely to experience moderate-to-severe symptoms versus patients on other systemics (p = .01) and on limited/no treatment (p = .04), and less likely to experience any symptoms versus patients on other systemics (p = .01). this effect was seen in our entire cohort and in the subgroup of patients with verified covid-19 or high-risk exposure.

conclusions: patients on dupilumab experienced less severe covid-19 manifestations and lesser symptoms compared with patients on other systemics and on limited/no treatment. these results suggest that th2 modulation with dupilumab may have a protective effect on anti-viral immune response in patients with ad."
iâ€™m also in the uk. iâ€™ve been on dupilumab for one month and itâ€™s pretty much cleared my eczema (which was severe). no side effects so far, although probably much too early to tell if iâ€™ll experience any. personally i would try dupilumab first, and then move on to rinvoq if dupilumab isnâ€™t effective/ you get side effects that are unmanageable. good luck whatever you decide!
"i would urge you to use the dupixent first. its less serious side effects makes it a superior medium term management option. having worse facial eczema or eye itch that go away when you stop (dupixent) is way more preferable than oral rinvoq's liver side effects. 

none of these eczema drugs are cures, they are short term treatments. their effects only last a few weeks after your last dose. so if you have an active allergy, which seems like you do, the eczema will just come right back when you stop. 

for a more permanent solution, i think you should continue with the allergy tests. keep testing and avoiding allergies until you get better. i had to migrate to get away from my allergen."
i've been on upadacitinib for almost two and a half years from the study and i haven't had any serious side effects. it's worked very well for me. i had more frequent cold sores the first year and i mean like once a month which is annoying but survivable, i've noticed t hat cuts get more easily infected. but both of those issues i had on cyclosporine plus a whole bunch more. i get the blood test every 3 months and the liver enzyme raised a bit at first and then leveled off. but other than that i haven't had any issues. i'm a fairly healthy slim 58-year-old woman. i have no interest in taking dupexint because i hate needles and i already have an issue with dry eyes because of another autoimmune disease, but actually the upa has helped a lot with that.
iâ€™ve been on dupixent for at least 4 years. itâ€™s controlled my severe eczema really well though i still have avoid the foods i react to most: seafood and nightshades. but, prior to dupixent, i had a little bit of acne on my face occasionally and now my face is a mess these last few years. i just never connected it to dupixent until very recently. (iâ€™ve had a lot of life going on.) anyway, i finally got serious about treating my terrible complexion and it turns out that i had a fungal overgrowth/acne and lupus erythema. i treated the fungal situation and started taking something for the cutaneous lupus but wondering if i really have lupus or if itâ€™s drug induced lupus and dupixent is suspect #1 for but fungal overgrowth & drug induced lupus. so iâ€™m investigating alternatives to dupixent but rinvoq sounds even worse in that respect. not sure what to do at this point but this is a good discussion. thanks for posting.
thanks for replies everyone. seeing my dermatologist tomorrow. still have some questions but thinking i will start on dupilumab and see how i get on. i think iâ€™ll be less anxious on it and if it works as well for me as it has for some of you iâ€™ll be very happy! if anyone is reading this and wants an update feel free to message me!
"also from the uk. iâ€™d highly recommend dupilumab, though i havenâ€™t heard of or used rinvoq. iâ€™ve been on dupilumab 300mg since december 22nd. iâ€™ve experienced zero side effects. iâ€™m being treated for atopic dermatitis, which includes hay fever allergies and asthma. my severe eczema on all areas of my body is completely cleared up. my asthma has gone and i now use a reliever inhaler once every two weeks. i no longer have allergic reactions like a blocked nose. 
whatever you choose i hope it goes well and brings some relief."
"three years on rinvoq gave me severe cystic acne, which they now control with daily 100 mg doxycycline. 

for me, control of eczema by rinvoq is intermittent. i still get frequent flares but the worst are less severe than pre rinvoq.

never tried dupixent."
you can honestly be on both. iâ€™ve been on both for years now. that said start dupixent first and add rinvoq if dupixent isnâ€™t enough to make your skin clear.
"both are pretty new, i'm basically just seeking the one that would make my life livable but also cause the least amount of known side effects, because god knows about the unknown long term side effects...

to that end i would choose dupixent. i'm biased since i'm using it but yeah.

and also dupixent made my face and neck flares 90% better anyways (i was pretty bad to start with though). my theory is if your eczema is pretty bad, dupixent will offer pretty good face/neck improvement still because it takes away the eczema you're currently experiencing and replaces it with a 'hot to the touch/sensitive patch' sensation in those areas, which for me was that 90% improvement. seeing as you were taking prednisone and cyclosporin i'm guessing you're pretty bad right now too. my guess is dupixent will show you pretty good improvement on that end.

the actual worst part of dupixent is the conjunctivitis. i have some of that too but it's livable. only case where i would consider doing rinvoq first is if you have a pre-existing eye condition because not being able to see properly even a little bit is unlivable."
"/late - australian (dupi 1 year)

no blood tests (well, apart from the test for helminths/worms. don't look it up as to why, i'm still scarred.) no having to shield (apart from close contact/plague quarantine) because i'm on an immunosuppressant.

dupixent has absolutely improved my quality of life. no flares (minus pms). one needle every fortnight. not every week. don't have to have folic acid every other day. 

don't have to really moisturise either. (i should, but, i don't.) 

my eyes aren't terribly dry, and i got a few facial flares but that was short lived. great stuff.   


downsides: the needles (we only have the syringe) are bloody huge, size wise (not the needle - that's tiny, but the shield/holster/box/spring) - and you can only fit 6 months of used syringes into a large sharps box. the pen is apparently coming. also it's $50 for two in australia on the pbs (subsidised. same for rinvoq.)"
"been on rinvoq trial since early 2019 so, 3.5 years. the first year was amazing as it cleared 99% of my eczema. to this day, my eczema is now probably 90% gone. however, i've been dealing with various viruses now and i don't think i can fight them since my immune system is modulated with rinvoq? had flat warts which spread very quickly everywhere during year 2 and still have them. tried veregen but it didn't really work (however you have to religiously use it and i don't think i did a good job with it - also expensive if you don't have insurance)

late october in 2021, i broke out in eczema herpeticum on my face which was the lowest point of my life. it spread all over my face and i looked like a zombie.. since then, i've been dealing with monthly, and lately weekly breakouts of hsv-1 in the face. i need to take valtrex right away to stop it from spreading like crazy and i'm worried my body is getting weaker at fighting it. my eczema has started coming back in my face, neck and bends of my arm and chest lately but it's nowhere near as bad as before. 

as someone who grew up with severe ad since birth, the best part of this drug is being able to sleep at night. i had never experienced a proper night's rest prior to starting and it really is life changing.

i took the drug for the 2 years straight and tried weening off it by doing every other day. that held up fine but i could tell on day 2 i was getting itchier at night. i went cold turkey for as long as i could after this and did not last 1 month. my eczema was coming back worse in spots i never had before (down there for example) and my skin was becoming thick. i had to resume because it was getting weepy, yellow, and unbearable at night..

honestly, if you can live without these drugs, i say try your best to. rinvoq really is a miracle drug in the sense that it will cure your eczema but at the cost of viruses (in my case) and becoming reliant on the drug. i worry about the long term use of this drug and the other side effects mentioned on their website.

i did not have the opportunity to get dupixent first before rinvoq, and definitely would try that first. from what i have read online, it is hit or miss but still promising and i think worth the chance first.

feel free to pm me if you have more questions!"
"interesting indeed!

my doc mentioned that with my allergies, asthma and eczema that my immune system is always in overdrive and on the lookout and most people like this experience fewer covid related symptoms and side effects as the body is quick to pick it up, which might explain why i haven't had it yet, although surrounded by it ( i'm a teacher).  soooo many kids in the classes i've taught have had it (whole classes and year levels wiped out by it), same with other teachers and support workers, or it could be the alcohol killing it too :d"
interesting!!
thatâ€™s great - so pleased to hear youâ€™re clear! did you have it severe on your face and neck too?
how long did dupilumab take to start working in 10 days in not much happening
"are you thinking of the right medication as liver issues are not mentioned on the information i received? are you thinking of methotrexate? just wondering where you saw that information? i love research! 
do you have personal experience of either?
no further allergy tests suggested. she did tell me i certainly have filaggrin deficiency but not much i can do about that"
thank you thatâ€™s helpful. glad itâ€™s worked for you. iâ€™m not a heavy drinker by any means but do enjoy the odd wine, should you not drink on upa? iâ€™ve never had cold sores, suspected herpeticum a week ago but they didnâ€™t swab so not sure (on antivirals) so am a bit worried about that. iâ€™ve also had shingles before but about 14 years ago so not recently. i have a 2 year old so not sure how much i can avoid viral things which seems to be the issue with upa!
thatâ€™s amazing! what immunosuppressant did you try previously and did it work? iâ€™m on ciclosporin 250mg a day and itâ€™s not really working
how is your acne on doxy? iâ€™m also interested in rinvoq but worried about the acne issue.
i donâ€™t think that was an option, but yeah maybe if one doesnâ€™t work i can try both. she said i can try the other if one fails. iâ€™m not seeing much success on ciclosporin so wondering if that means one will work better than the other?
thank you. what were you on before dupixent, if anything? ciclosporin really isnâ€™t working for me and itâ€™s a pretty potent immunosuppressant so wondering if dupixent wonâ€™t work? hard to know!
thatâ€™s great thanks! i think i can get the pens here in the uk? not sure but if storage is my biggest issue i can handle that! and we donâ€™t have to pay, thank you nhs! yes the no monitoring is nice and reassuring! i will not google worms! but my derm did mention that parasitic infection is a risk so not to â€œtravel to thailand and eat pigs head from the side of the roadâ€ which as a vegan i am not planning to do!!!
you can use any thick plastic container such as an empty bleach jug as a sharps container. i use a dishwashing detergent pods bucket and it holds a lot of syringes & pen injectors.
"it shouldnâ€™t decrease your likelihood of getting it. i think this study or a related one actually showed that being on dupixent increases your likelihood of getting it, but decreases symptoms significantly. this study also specifies that dupixent decreases the symptoms in patients with ad, who would, according to the theory your doctor is referring to, already have lower symptoms - but if iâ€™m correct that your doctor is referring to the decreased likelihood of cytokine storm, that theory has been disproven/canâ€™t be proven.

there are other traits that can decrease your likelihood of getting it, for instance blood type:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc8286549/#:~:text=zhao%20et%20al%20found%20that,0.60%e2%80%930.75%3b%20p%20%3c%20.

i also have not tested positive for covid yet despite having several close exposures (including one, unmasked, pre-vaxxed, with a roommate the day before he showed symptoms). i donâ€™t know my blood type (iâ€™m too small to donate blood). there are probably other traits we donâ€™t know about that affect our chance of being infected.

i say â€œi havenâ€™t tested positiveâ€ because i think thereâ€™s a high probability iâ€™ve had it and just was tested at the wrong time/didnâ€™t have a high enough viral load to test positive."
also iâ€™ve been on dupixent for 3 years, pretty minimal side effects (<1 week facial flares once a year, changes in appetite but not weight), and dupixent myway is an incredible program that not only subsidizes the drug but also has a 24 hour hotline for patients that will connect you with a real nurse. many reasons to love it!
i had eczema on my face- temples, eyelids and around my lips. sometimes on my cheeks and forehead. also the back of my neck but my neck eczema probably wasnâ€™t in itself â€˜severeâ€™. my facial/neck eczema disappeared within days of starting treatment and no flare ups since. not even eumovate or protopic had been able to clear it previously
"when my dermatologist suggested oral rinvoq, she said liver tests were required. 

i have personal experience with dupixent. i've taken it for 2 periods, it was not strong enough to help me with my class 5 dust mite allergy on its own. 

i ended up migrating to get away from dust mites as i exhausted my drug options. before the move, i was on 4 immunosuppressants (prednisolone, dupixent, methotrexate and azathioprine) and still could only sleep 2 hours a night."
"[https://www.rxabbvie.com/pdf/rinvoq\_medguide.pdf](https://www.rxabbvie.com/pdf/rinvoq_medguide.pdf)

second page. para 8 describes the liver tests."
"have you looked into l histidine supplementation? there was a study and anecdotes that indicates it works well for ad due to filaggrin deficiency. didnt work for me personally, my skin was never particularly dry before i got eczema so might not be filaggrin related. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc5634381/"
yeah it does knock out your viral suppression. i had a few very minor episodes of shingles but i normally get that every year anyway so. ive probably had it 15 times in my life and only the first few were really bad. now it's just a little annoying.
i was prescribed ccyclosporine 300mg daily but it had minimal effect on my eczema. the side effects were really bad for me. because of a medication iâ€™m taking unrelated to my eczema i couldnâ€™t be prescribed methotrexate, so i was then prescribed dupilumab
cleared it up instantly. remarkable. i still get some, but it's far fewer and smaller spots than before.
if youâ€™re not seeing success with cyclosporine youâ€™ll most likely need both tbh. was on cyclosporine before doing cyclosporine and dupixent, but my skin was still flaring so i had to add something else back in.
to provide an alternative, i have been on dupixent for more than three years now and recently have not managed my face, scalp and neck seborrheic dermatitis well. i was prescribed opzelura along my shots and it honestly has been very relieving for my flares in those places.
"hmm, sounds like me. i was taking prednisone and cyclosporin on and off with full body eczema including face and neck, and it worked at first but it started losing effect in 2018 and 2019. luckily, i started dupixent in 2019 and haven't had real problems relatively speaking since. so there may be hope for you.

and can i just say, the side effects under prednisone are way worse than the ones under dupixent.. for me at least. lol."
"oh, good! 

you probably can get the pens in the uk! we keep ours in the fridge (australia). 

i don't mind nationalised healthcare. what a great thing it is (occaisonally!)"
"sadly, can't put that in the council sharps pickup / can't put syringes into the general trash. (or to the dump either, i don't think they take needles there.) 

it's not a huuuge deal. the boxes are free to get from the chemist, and free to deposit at the council office. just have to go out of my way. 

it's a good solution, though!"
did you try other immunosuppressants first? ciclosporin isnâ€™t working so am anxious that dupilumab or even rinvoq wonâ€™t work either!
migrate away from dust mites? i thought they were kinda universal.
"hmmmm. interesting. of all the side effects she spoke to me about she didnâ€™t mention liver. it reads as though you shouldnâ€™t take it if your liver enzymes are high but not that it will cause damage itself? and if it can cause issues as they monitor it regularly iâ€™m not sure thatâ€™s enough for me to worry about really as if thereâ€™s an issue they will switch me to something else? 
i guess nothing comes without risks, even dupilumab! iâ€™m nervous dupilumab will not work same as you, and could even cause worsening facial flares. i was considering getting more blood tests done privately as they didnâ€™t test me for everything, i had to choose what to test and it came back with grass pollen only (hard to avoid!!)."
yes but canâ€™t find much to back up this claim and the study was done by the company who make the supplement so iâ€™m not really sure about it. literally canâ€™t find anyone online saying it worked!
did you find ciclosporin worked for you at all?
ok that gives me some hope then!! how long were you on it until you felt you were cleared up? iâ€™m typically flaring badly today, two days after my derm appointment! isnâ€™t it always the way?!
just so i know what to expect should i choose dupilumab when did the facial flares happen (how many weeks/days into treatment) and how long did they last? thatâ€™s the bit iâ€™m most nervous about as my face and neck are in a real mess and if those areas improve that will greatly improve quality of life!
i never tried any of the immunosuppressants. when i was first offered them, i was too anxious about the side effects, and then by the time i was so desperate i would try anything i was lucky that my dermatologist offered dupixent. iâ€™m hoping so much for you that either rinvoq or dupixent will work!
"dust mites cannot reproduce when the humidity is under 50%. it is a matter of finding a location that has low humidity indoors for long stretches of the year. i would recommend 40% for at least 6 months of the year. 

if the dry spell is long enough, an entire generation of dust mites will die of old age before laying new eggs, thus cleansing all indoor spaces of dust mites.

you can either select a location that is already dry, like a desert. or you can select a location that has a long winter, indoor heating is the best dehumidifier, and if winter is long and cold like in michigan, all the heaters in the region have to be turned on, dropping the humidity of all indoor spaces to 30% for long periods."
"oddly enough, the liver tests were the only thing she talked to me about before i declined. dupilumab's side effects are very temporary and quite confined to the face. 

well, for grass pollen, i'd keep the doors and windows closed and get an air purifier. you should test more, allergy avoidance is the key to going symptom free without drugs."
are you sure? like the one i linked was done by the company? ive seen yt videos of some guy praising it. to each their own, these things are usually lower probability anyway.
yeah it was great but i had all the side effects including high blood pressure. the doc said the high blood pressure would go away when i stopped the pills but over 2 years later it is still with me ðŸ˜•
i started noticing results after three weeks of taking dupilumab. the eczema was completely cleared around week 5
"ooh, i think it lasted a few days? i got a shock and thought i'd eaten something i shouldn't have. 

probably third jab (week 6?)

i also am on topical tacrolimus (don't, it's itchy - it helps, but my god it is itchy)

others may be able to help out on when theirs kicks off - but it was definitely may/june last year, about jab 3-8."
damn that's interesting. thanks a lot for explaining.
"yeah in the disclosure it says: 
disclosure
cemg reports grants from zymogenetics, stiefel, and
regeneron, grants and personal fees from novartis
and pfizer. nkg is a founding director of curapel, a
university of manchester spin-out company owning
patents in this field. the other authors report no
conflicts of interest in this work.

curapel sell pellamex which has the exact dosage trialled in this study. itâ€™s not unusual for pharmaceuticals to fund trials but it isnâ€™t totally unbiased so you do have to be a bit wary with such small clinical trials that have really good results. i keep thinking â€œfuck it iâ€™ll try itâ€ but iâ€™ve spent Â£Â£Â£Â£ on my eczema and donâ€™t want to waste any more!!! and iâ€™m in the uk so thatâ€™s even with free healthcare! iâ€™m waiting to find some really good anecdotal evidence that it really works before investing, iâ€™ll look up that video - do you have a link? 
will link the curapel web page[https://curapel.com/our-products/](https://curapel.com/our-products/)"
sorry just reading that dupixent actually contains l histidine! so i guess when i start dupixent iâ€™ll be getting that supplementation anyway but that is making me think for those not able to get dupixent they would maybe benefit from this supplement. definitely something in it!
"yeah iâ€™ve been on tacrolimus for a year, worked great on my face but has stopped working and never worked that well on my body. youâ€™re right itâ€™s sooooo itchy! i never got the burning but the itching is maddening. 
ok thatâ€™s good to know thanks. some people seem to think/say the flares are fungal?"
"interesting but thats just one of the sponsors which also includes regeneron (dupixent). good dd tho. heres the video i saw:

https://youtu.be/v8kckxlpf7i"
"no idea on the fungal discussion!

i definitely know the excema group i'm in, they've been grumbling about eyes and eye dryness. we seem to be all given the same products - whatever it is, it's got carmelose sodium in it!"
ive been on it 6 weeks and my crp is lower than its been in yeaaaaars. i still have crohns symptoms tho and horrible acne from it. it may just need more time to help my symptoms, but seems like inflammation is going downâ€¦.

"took about a week to notice a big difference, and by a month i had kinda ""plateaued"" in terms of improvement.   


i'm at like 2 months ish now, with nothing particularly interesting to report side effect wise. i might be breaking out more often, but i'm not 100% sold its rinvoq's fault yet."
i get a lot of acne. 37m.
on for a month and have been feeling better. acne and scalp sensitivity/breakouts have been noticeable but will manage of it means less crohnâ€™s issues.
what do you mean by breaking out? flaring ? i feel like iv been on a constant flare since november last year.
"oh, like mild acne. 

i've just been working out more than usual and not washing my face as much as i should, thus, not sure if its the meds or just a me thing."
r/eczejaks has a lot of peoples experience on rinvoq! helpful spot!
"iâ€™ve heard it can sometimes be a fungal infection. 

i noticed improvement with the proactive treatment, especially the stuff meant to dry your skin out due to excess oil. i am much oilier on rinvoq"
"i had some acne success using raw honey as a facewash (hop in shower, rub it on, rinse off). if it doesnâ€™t work, well you can eat the rest on toast! full disclosure: am a beekeeper. 
really not missing the rinvoq acne, though it wasnâ€™t worth getting pjp to get off of it."
hmm, if it might be fungal, maybe trying an anti dandruff shampoo could help?

worked in a week in my case and god knows i have done them all! easy to take, no side effects here. my favorite crohn mÃ©dication so far. good luck op!
i started it about 3 months ago, and it's been a wonder drug! i feel healthier than i have in a decade. it started working pretty quick, and ramped up over about 2 months. the only side effect that's really bothered me is acne, but it's a price i'm willing to pay! i still steer clear of salads, but otherwise i almost feel normal.  fingers crossed it does the same for you!
its been out for uc for a bit, i was on xeljanz a sister med, it works really well. statistically and anecdotally people do really good on it
"i failed off of stelara last may. i was waiting on surgery but in august started rinvoq instead. i felt relief within 3 days. i started at 45mg for about 2 months and then dropped down to 30mg. in january 2023 i had a colonoscopy that showed remission. at the end of february i started having breakthrough symptoms again and we bumped my dose back up to 45mg. we are waiting to see how it works. 

when i started rinvoq at 45mg, i missed my period for 2 months. my doctor said that there were no known hormonal effects of rinvoq but it was possible that it was effecting my period. it is just that it is really new with not a lot of studies specifically on women. after dropped to 30mg, my period came back. i have not been on the higher dose long enough to see if it effects my period again.

also, when i started last fall, i got a lot of zits on my scalp. like a lot! my scalp just ached. i figured out some over the counter stuff that worked well for me. i also started getting alot of cysts all over my body particularly in my armpits, pubic area, back, and breasts. i finally got diagnosed with hidradenitis suppervativa in january. i donâ€™t know if it is related but wanted to make sure that i mentioned it. 

other than that, i also got bad headaches form rinvoq but those went away after a month."
wow! what did you notice after the week? thatâ€™s such a fast response, so happy for you ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥² how long have you been taking it? and whatâ€™s the biggest improvement youâ€™ve noticed?
thatâ€™s great for you! super hopeful it will work the same for me, would you say youâ€™re near remission or? whatâ€™s your stool inflammation levels like now if you donâ€™t mind me asking? mine are currently 1250 i really want them to go down for summer. thatâ€™s such a shame about the acne lmao i only just got rid of my terrible acne after three years of constant spots ðŸ˜­ but if it can get me healthy i guess iâ€™ll take it hahah
thatâ€™s positive! thank you for letting me know, would you say the sister drug has put u in remission?
wow, 3 days is so fast. spots all over your scalp sounds sooo painful omg, and the cysts too i really hope i donâ€™t have that side effect. did the spots/cysts go away? also are you still taking it? and are you still in remission?
"well, first of all: solid poop! no more diarrhea 10 to 15 times a day. i would go only once or twice. that was the biggest change. way less tired, more energy in general. 

i took it for 2 months before surgery. my colon was beyond saving sadly. but i am so glad to have find med that works quickly although it doesnâ€™t stay in the blood for a long time. another thing i like; no infusion, no needle. three little pills once a day. such a relief!"
i haven't had a colonoscopy since starting so i don't have an official remission, but it's as close to it as i've been since i was on remicade for the first time, back in the 2000's. i don't have a recent stool test (because my symptoms have been largely non-existent!) but my crp from blood work was in normal range after 2 months (again for the first time in a decade!). the acne is annoying, but i've kept it to a minimum by washing my face more often each day (no set schedule, but after i sweat usually). my nurse says the acne should go away in another month or two, and it does seem a bit calmer than when i first started. it's also nice that its a daily pill, so i don't have to fuss with injections
it did but it didnt workout long term
"yes still taking it. i suspect (but have no proof or studies to cite) that the rinvoq triggered my hs which is also an auto immune issue. similar to how some people get lupis induced by biologics. so i will be dealing with the cysts for the rest of my life. i have stage 2 hs so not too bad. if it gets worse, i am looking at starting humira for it. i still take rinvoq at a higher does of 45mg. it is not working as well as my doctor and i hoped so we are kinda waiting to see if i need surgery. iâ€™ve been trying to reach remission for 8 years now. i have tried tons of meds that work for a few months to 18 months and then i flare again. i told my doctor after rinvoq, i donâ€™t want to try anything else so my option is a protocolectomy which i am ok with. so my scalp cleared up with regular use of scalp specific products.

here are a list of products i used that i thing really helped. also check out the subreddit for rheumatoid arthritis if you want more peopleâ€™s experiences on rinvoq. it has been approved for them longer.

sorry to hear that about your colon but wow!! i would loooove to have solid poops again. are you still taking it?
also another question, whatâ€™s the biggest improvement youâ€™ve noticed being on it? do you still suffer with diarrhoea and urgent bowel movements? for me the thing i would loooove to go away is needing the toilet in the night and having no bowel control
wow thatâ€™s so great! aw iâ€™m so happy that itâ€™s working for you, sounds like such a promising drug. do we know if itâ€™s supposed to be a long term drug like a biologic? i havenâ€™t had a chat with my nurses yet going through the drug with me so iâ€™m curious if you know. anyway though so happy youâ€™re doing well
sorry to hear that, do you have uc or crohns?
thank you for all this info thatâ€™s so nice of you, after googling hs i actually wonder whether thatâ€™s what i have been experiencing the last year. small spots and nodules in both my armpits that are really sore, went to a gp early on about it and she brushed it off as a bacterial thing from shaving my armpits but since then i have shaved my armpits maybe like 3 times and i still get spots. iâ€™m a bit worried now and maybe itâ€™s worth i mention this to my doctor and nurses when they go over the drug with me before starting. also thank you so much for the links, super thoughtful
"i wish that it helps you as much as it did helped me!

no, not taking meds as for now since i got my colon removed 3 weeks ago. will go back on it if ever crohn decided to attack another part of my digestive system."

uc, just started remicade, also didnt respond to stelara
shaving really sets off my hs. i now use nair for hair removal. also, people with crohns have a higher chance of getting hs. they are definitely linked! good luck on your journey!
whoa!! like your whole colon? thatâ€™s so intense how are you feeling? you are so strong, iâ€™m so scared of ever getting surgery
also so sorry for all the questions - this is my last one, i see a lot of comments saying it gave them bad face acne/cysts on their body. one person said it effected their period, seems like it can effect our hormones. did you experience anything like that? thank you for being so responsive
yeah iâ€™m so annoyed i didnâ€™t respond to stelara , i hate the feeling of running out of options
cool that thereâ€™s a cross over between our medications, i assume you canâ€™t take rivoq?
ah. i donâ€™t think so. i had acne but it was mainly due to prednisone i had taken before. and i have not had period for a long time due to my contraception method. so sadly, i canâ€™t really answered ðŸ˜ž
stelaras kinda ass, statistically its decent but anecdotally people do not do well on it. literally at the infusion center yesterday some guy who was in remission for 15 years on remicade says stelara was like injecting water didnt do a thing for him either. and the people on the different ibd subs tend to have the same consensus. anecdotally ive seen the best from remicade, the jak injibitors (rinvoq, xeljanz), and imuran
i can, its whats most likely next if theres no other good med drops by the time remicade stops working or doesnt work but im kinda holding out that this is gonna work for a long time since not only is it remicade but were comboing it with imuran which is also good long term
well i wish you so much luck with your medication journey i hope you get long term use and stay feeling goodâ¤ï¸
i was in a stubborn flare recently and not responding to oral pred. already failed most drugs but was given option of iv steroids in hospital or trying upadacitinib so tried it first and was feeling better within days. hoping it continues :-).
[deleted]
"iâ€™ve been on upadacitinib for about 5 weeks. i was also nervous to start given the side effects. the side effects so far has mostly been acne and fatigue, but both are quite manageable. 

you usually will have blood monitoring for the time you are on the drug, just to make sure everything is under control. 

as for effectiveness, i know for a lot of people they can see improvement within days. but it can also take 2 to 8 weeks to see improvement, so donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t see improvement straight away. iâ€™m 5 weeks in and only just starting to see a few minor improvements. nonetheless, itâ€™s still faster than biologics. my disease is also quite severe, which is why it might be taking longer for me. 

the side effects definitely freaked me out a bit, but if you have any concerns, definitely talk to your ibd nurses or consultant, they definitely helped me feel more reassured."
hey iâ€™m in the uk and had to make the same decision as you yesterday! i also went for upa over risan because i felt like i needed to try something entirely different and as its a jak inhibitor i went with that instead though still a little nervous about it. itâ€™s funny that theyâ€™re now letting people make a choice - they mustâ€™ve had quite a lot of new drugs approved recently!!

super glad to hear! hoping it has the same effect for myself!
fingers crossed!
thanks for the detailed response, definitely put me a bit more at ease, i've organised a call with the obd team today to ask a few questions!
yeah that was semi my outlook! wish they'd had his many 16 years ago, i would have got into such a state to begin with ðŸ™ƒ
"itâ€™s a new drug that was recently approved by the drug safety group after clinical trials showed some safety and efficacy data. 

as a community we wonâ€™t know real numbers for real world patients until itâ€™s been on the market for ~ 18 months

thereâ€™s a growing community called r/eczejaks talking about these jak inhibitors for atopic dermatitis"
i was going to get in dupixent again soon, but now in my seeing this i will discuss with my dr if trying rinvoq instead of dupixent would be an option, as i'd prefer an oral pill to injection and the success rate seems good too.  i reacted very well to dupixent, like it almost damn near fully cured me,  so i would be switching mostly for the benefit of not having injections.
i'm currently taking a very similar jak inhibitor (abrocitinib) as part of a clinical trial. you can check my post history for more info, but in summary it's been crazy effective for my severe eczema. the only other thing that has ever been this effective has been prednisone, but you can't take prednisone long term so that was never a real solution for me. this is.
just wondering, what dose are you on and do you tend to take it in the morning or evenings? currently been on upadacitinib for 3 days now :) on 15mg
hey u/goldengiraffe999 how are you doing now on the pill?
that's amazing! i'm happy that dupixent worked for you and hope you can get on upadacitinib as well. are you in australia? i will be given the medicine for free until it falls under the pbs scheme here
hey thanks for your reply! may i ask how long you have been taking abrocitinib and how long it took for it to be effective for you?
congrats on three days!! i currently am on 15mg too and take it in the evening straight after dinnet :). how are you with the medication? any improvements?
"hey! i'll try to include as much detail as possible, hopefully this helps! so far i've been on it for nine days and my rashes have nearly disappeared. 

i do not scratch when i sleep and my insomnia disappeared after day one of taking the pill. i sleep at 12 (tonight just stayed up to watch some movies) and wake up at 7 with no fatigue. i used to scratch myself to sleep and usually slept at 4 and slept in because i never got deep sleep.

after shower my body used to feel really really dry and i would have to apply cream straight away but nowadays i let myself air dry before applying cream.

i had around 80% spread over my body and now it's nearly non existent. i do get red when i am doing high intensity cardio but it calms down after i dry off the sweat.

i experience absolutely no itchiness. i tend to itch out of habit but i have been doing less and less every day.

i feel so good this medication has been a godsend and i am getting my brother and my mates on it who also have eczema.

i can actually take warm showers and my skin doesn't hurt or itch.

i also have not touched topical steroids since starting this drug and i hope this means i will never have to rely on the steroids ever again.

if you have mild to extreme eczema and have no quality of life, i 100000% recommend this medication. it has saved me and i look forward to waking up every morning and not having to moisturise myself before i walk around in pain."
"i am in germany, i moved here in july to be with my now husband.

the drug i get on will likely depend on prices and what the dr reccomends"
"i've been on it for just over 5 months now. within a few days the itching had gone down to almost nothing, within two weeks ago the open wounds had all closed, and within a month everything was healed and my skin was almost fully clear. since then it has stayed mostly that way. an absolute life changer.

major side effects i noticed were nausea for the first week or two and headaches for about 3 weeks."
"i'm so happy for how effective it is for you! i'm also on the same scheme (vic) and stumbled upon your post when researching this (currently waiting for my delivery). 

did your dermatologist mentioned anything about the pbs listing? i tried to look up information on the pbac but couldn't find much. worried that it might end up not getting listed.

are you concerned about the safety profile? seem to have a higher risk profile than dupixent from my research but the pros seems like it outweighs the cons."
hope youre still doing well! was wondering if you've experienced any side effects yet, heard acne and weight gain are common
i see, i hope you can get your hands on it and it works for you. all the bestðŸ˜Š
"did the side effects disappear after the first few weeks? i was actually on a clinical trial for abrocitinib and dropped out after the first couple weeks due to the exact same side effects, nausea and headaches.

in terms of treating eczema it was even more effective than dupixent for me as it also cleared up my facial eczema."
that sounds amazing! i have a bad habit of scratching in my sleep. by any chance did you have the same problem and did the medication help with this?
"thanks! i hope it does wonders for you! how has it been? have you received the medication yet?

my dermo didn't talk about pbs but the rinvoq company sent over a pamphlet stating that the medication will fall under pbs by next year dec or even earlier. until then we will be receiving the medication for free and then after that we will need a prescription and it will be around $40 a month.

i definitely think it has its rare side effects however i plan to stay on it for maybe a year until everything clears up and i hope i don't need to rely on topical steroids after the year (i haven't touched steroids since starting upad). if my eczema returns after i stop using upad, i may try dupixent or hop back on upad. tbh anything is better than going through the pain of eczema"
thanks! i dont think i have experienced any side effects. i think maybe acne but i might have gotten it because i have been eating bad food for the past two weeks. i dont weigh myself but dont think i have gained any weight from it.
"yep, both of those side effects have disappeared. initially both would appear about a hour after taking the meds. the nausea was relatively mild and i didn't have to take any meds for that, but the headaches were more significant and i needed tylenol for it.

i found through my own trial and error that the headache would be substantially reduced if i took the meds after eating a full meal. the headaches mostly went away after 3-4 weeks, as long as i still took the meds after food. nowadays i can take the meds at any time without headaches, though i still take them after dinner as a force of habit."
the meds made the itching almost completely disappear. before i was always itchy at pretty much all hours of the day. during the day i could control the scratching so that i didn't open up new wounds or aggravate existing ones, but at night i couldn't and i'd end up scratching to the point of bleeding. that's all changed now, i sleep way better, don't scratch while i sleep, and the itches i do get are minor and never get scratched to the point of opening wounds.
"just got it this morning. how long did it take for you to notice a difference?

honestly hoping the quality of life is a big improvement. i think the potential small risks are worth it."
i'm glad it's worked so well for you. i'm praying it works for me like that too. would it be possible if i were to have any questions that i dm you? thanks so much for your replies. i appreciate it.
"i experienced instant relief in terms of itchiness and redness. the redness died down maybe by half and i was not itchy after i took it. these effects took place maybe 45 mins in?

i am sure it will have a great effect on you too! dm me on how it goes! wishing you all the best ðŸ™‚"
yep, feel free to dm me any time.
thanks so much!!
sounds like you still have a skin infection.
"for me it took only a couple of days for it to work, but i feel like if it worked the first time for you it's going to keep on working.

i had a couple of skin infections since i started taking it but then started taking aciclovir each time one of them sprung up and it stopped being a major problem"
r/eczejaks is a subreddit for upadacitinib discussion, can also try asking there
i don't, i had swabs before i was released and they came back negative.
thanks, nice to know. that's interesting, i was released from hospital on the 13th october and was on acylovir and antibiotics, infection went but was still healing, so i'm wondering if i'm still healing. i am to take acylovir everyday for 3 months but started upadacitinib a week ago today but the itch is like 100/10. just one of those where it's like, how do i know if it's working, how long to give it, is there something wrong with my skin again or do i need to give it time. been anxious ever since i was so bad with the infection, it really messes with you mentally.
thanks ðŸ™‚
weeping of the skin is indicative of infection. maybe you don't but i'd check again.
i completely understand you. hope it all gets better :)
"not necessarily. three key indicators are weeping of skin, yellow crusting and red inflamed skin. 

having one of the three indicators is not conclusive to say that a person has a skin infection."
weeping of the skin also happens with just having atopic dermatitis
2 out of 3?
at this point if it's really running your mind in circles, i'd just have it looked at by your gp. safest bet rather than asking probably unqualified people online.
"iâ€™ve been on rinvoq for 9 weeks now. i was put on 45mg for the first 8 weeks then my gi switched me to 30mg and wants to keep me there for 6 months or so before seeing if we can go to down to 15mg.  
  
the first couple of weeks i started to develop some sort of weird numbness sensation in my legs. i thought it was a blood clot because thatâ€™s one of the potential side effects. however, after doing an ultrasound, it was nothing. it went away a week or so later. the only other symptoms i seem to notice is a lot more acne on my face and my scalp.  
  
i recently had some blood work done after being on the meds for 9 weeks. my crp level is normal, my calprotectin is also normal. recently iâ€™ve been developing formed stools and having 1-2 bowel movements a day. as of now i would say that rinvoq is working for me and hope it continues.  
  
prior to rinvoq i was on apriso->6mp->more mesalamine->entyvio->avsola and steroids in between. all of which were not effective except steroids and avsola which did help with symptoms but not the inflammation."
only drug thatâ€™s worked for me after mesalamine, remicade, and humira all failed (not counting steroids). i think the thing about immune suppression is to go to a doctor early if you get an infection. i let a minor skin infection go a little too long thinking it would resolve on its own and i had to have an abscess drained. all is good now though. i can actually live now!
been on it since feb 2022 and the only side effect iâ€™ve experience is acne. honestly itâ€™s not as bad tho cos i have my life back. and as long as i keep up my skin care routine, i can get pass the stubborn acne. i hope to continue this meds for a while. only thing that would get in the way is insurance down the road. if you have any qs let me know!
"i have been on it for 15 weeks and it has been working well! did the 45mg induction dose and my doc wants me to stay on the 30mg long term. no side effects. 

my uc has been very stubborn (rinvoq is the 5th drug iâ€™ve tried) so i am very thankful for this drug."
"i started in early august, so at 9 weeks now.

we did a bit of a work around to even get me on these meds as i don't really have a history of failing other medication -- only mesalamine.

so far it's been great. i have been symptom free since 2 days after starting the meds. i just had a bunch of blood work done and have an appointment with my gi doc on monday to go over the results.

if i have any side effects they've been pretty mellow and it would be hard for me to point specifically to the medication as the cause. i have more acne, am more tired, and having trouble losing weight, but i could also attribute those to lifestyle changes made since i've been symptom free."
hi! have you had any fever as side effects of rinvoq?
"hi ðŸ˜âœŒï¸

same dose for me.
i heard often now, that people getting acne while using rinvoq. i hope i don't get it. but i never had problems with acne, so im optimistic.

and yes, the point with the blood work is one of my worries. my gl said, the cholesterol level can increase. on tuesday they will test my blood for the first time with rinvoq. i hope all meters are fine too.

and it gives me hope.
i made the same experience. in my time with cu, i got much meds. all of them, except simponi which destroyed my skin, didn't helped so far. so i understand you. and im happy for you, that rinvoq works fine for you! i hope it keeps going like that!!!

thanks for your comment!
stay healthy!âœŒï¸"
"sounds great ðŸ˜
that gives me hope ðŸ˜

thx & stay healthy!"
"sounds good.
im intrestet about your results. 
especially about the blood test. my gl said, the cholesterol can increase. happend already? or at the same level?"
the only time i had a fever while on rinvoq was when i had covid around 5 weeks back.
my cholesterol has gone up a little, red blood cell count down a little. all still normal-ish ranges. i'm not a doctor though so curious to see what my gi says on monday.
thank you for your reply!
i am currently on it. brand name rinvoq, itâ€™s easier to remember than upadacitinib. it pulled me out of the worse flare up of my life even when prednisone wasnâ€™t doing it for me. itâ€™s put me on a fast track to remission. and i mean, yea it has a black box warning or whatever, but i mean most people stop responding to jobs after a few years. itâ€™s just a few years and then there hopefully will be better advancements in the field of ibd medicines for you to try.
hey thanks for the reply. iâ€™m currently on a drop down course of steroids atm, and they are keen to put me on rinvoq when i get to 20mg a day of prednisone. do you have any links you can share about the drug and itâ€™s treatment for uc - i canâ€™t find much anywhere. they are also wanting to follow my treatment and symptoms during as a trial. it all seem very new. daunting. i fly as a flight attendant and they are also mentioning blood lots as a side effect.
i have not been prescribed this but i have recently been put on filgotinib which is a very new drug also. good luck + i hope this one works for you!
"i haven't been prescribed this. it can be a slow process to move from one biologic to another due to nice guidelines, and how long it can take for a biologic to work. 

you might see other people here talk about rinvoq, which is the brand name

i saw the following news story about it. 

https://crohnsandcolitis.org.uk/news-stories/news-items/upadacitinib-to-be-available-as-a-treatment-option-for-ulcerative-colitis-throughout-the-uk"
how has filgotnib been for you? i'm on it for 2 months now with slow but good results
iâ€™m only on day 5 atm so nothing just yet! keeping my fingers crossed
hey. wanted to ask, i'm almost a week in and i'm absolutely exhausted, sleeping for 13 hours a day. not sure if this is the colitis (could be) but more curious if this is something you experienced with filgotinib? thanks!
not really, i haven't noticed any major side effects so far. hope it gets better for you!

hey thatâ€™s really tough. iâ€™m actually on rinvoq currently and itâ€™s helped tremendously. iâ€™ve heard good things about the jaks in general tho but proud of you for advocating for yourself. also iâ€™m likely moving to the uk next year but now nervous they wonâ€™t have my medicine. do you know how you can check if they will have rinvoq for me? also do you know if private insurance cover rinvoq?
i'm not so sure about not being able to switch between. i am on xeljanz, and the back up plan is rinvoq if it starts to fail (already the maintenance dose is too low to control my disease adequately, but i've been on it since nov 2019).
i have private insurance but they donâ€™t cover the meds. one month of rinvoq costs Â£3.5k!
yeah im similar and also in the uk. you can definitely switch between jaks and that's the plan for me too if i fail tofacitinib.
how's your experience with xeljanz? i am starting soon. i failed entivyo and remicade before and now this is where i am headed
thatâ€™s so crazy!!! itâ€™s 10k in the us but i get it for 5 dollars through insurance and a couponâ€¦. lol. man thatâ€™s so tough! if you donâ€™t mind me asking about where are you located ? iâ€™ll be moving to newcastle and i didnâ€™t see upadacitimab listed on their lists of meds so now iâ€™m nervous. i hope you can get to the hospital you need!!!! hopefully it becomes more available because itâ€™s a good drug!
"iâ€™m in london. i was being taken care of at uclh which is a really good hospital. iâ€™m moving to guys and st thomas, another teaching hospital.
i would look to find a contact for the ibd pharmacy in the local hospitals and ask them if rimvoq is available.
the nhs is under immense pressure at the moment so there is enormous cost cutting in place."
thank you very much for the advice. thatâ€™s really tough about the cuts because the nhs is such an important institution for peopleâ€¦ i am glad you found an option. hang in there!!! and side note rinvoq is the best drug iâ€™ve been on. iâ€™ve had minimal side effects (a little acne with initial loading doses but also was on prednisone so couldâ€™ve been that.) i think you are absolutely making the right decision!!
thank you for your kind words!
seems extremely weird to change if current treatment works. even if you have mild inflammation still, going straight to upadaticinib skips over many great medications with lower risk profiles and less potential side effects. perhaps you can try mesalazine suppositories or other local treatment? or a short local steroid treatment (like budesonide enemas or foam) to get rid of the last inflammation?
join the jak inhibitors for alopecia facebook group if you havenâ€™t already! they are so helpful and there are many other people in clinical trials in the group. thanks so much to you for participating in the trial, it will lead us to more approved medication.
please do make posts, thank you for being willing to share!
"hiii, you think you could talk to me via dms? 
iâ€™m in a situation similar to this and would love to speak to you"
hi! i know this is an old post but i would be interested to know how you progressed with the trial if you donâ€™t mind?
any updates??
i will definitely look into it, thanks!
sure thing, just shoot me a dm whenever
upacreekwithnopaddle? hope it works!
rinvoq was approved for uc last year.
yeah, one of the benefits of this med is how fast it works. i felt completely back to normal, pre-diagnosis normal in 2 days.

basically cured, is quite strong to say for drugs you need to take every 1-2 weeks the rest of your life to maintain the gains...just saying.
i'm interested in knowing if this can be prescribed by the gp or if i'll have to go the dermatology route - i'd rather avoid that as i'm sick of seeing dermatologists who can't grasp the idea that steroids weren't working for me and that's why i stopped using them! my gp has a background in dermatology so will try him first.
see r/eczejaks for more info.
after taking it for a few years they will probably have new and improved versions tbh
"fairly hard to get is my understanding, i think you need to have tried a systemic immunosuppressant before they'll let you go on any kind of biologic. there's a nice page for baricitinib which is a similar drug: https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta681

i imagine it might be the same deal with the others but certainly worth a try, please let us know how you get on. i'm currently trying to get on ciclosporine!"
i will maintain my scepticism. eczema is always a pain in the ass cause they do only treat the symptoms but we don't know the cause of those symptoms, so until then we won't see but temporary treatments.
"interesting - my gp was/is happy for me to use tacrolimus long term as i understand the risks with it, and as i said, the dermatologist i saw was only interested in pushing steroids (i'm 30, diagnosed at 6mo and was using them from the age of 2 or 3 to 25.) when, at that point, i'd given up on steroids and wanted to try a systemic immunosuppressant! the end result of that was being discharged for ""refusing treatment"" and that was when i ended up seeing my gp & explaining everything and he was just like, ""yeah, i'll prescribe tacrolimus.""

it previously worked for me, but now i'm wondering if i just have ""too much"" eczema (i'd say 33% of my body, easily, is covered.) - it really got worse after i lost my partner last year. it's also a lot of area to cover with tacrolimus and the greasiness definitely inhibits what you can do for a couple of hours. :/

thanks for your input, and good luck to you too! :)"
true but i don't mind taking them daily for rest of my life as long as eczema stays away cause i live in uk and its free
"i am so, so sorry. this is such a heartbreaking story. grief and a autoimmune problems just seem to go hand in hand - not being listened to just adds to the stress. leads to a vicious cycle. i really hope it works out for you and i hope i didn't sound dismissive, i was looking into the possibility of upadacitinib myself the other week and came across the nice thing and got a bit excited to share what i found - thought it might be helpful to structure your argument! it sucks that some professionals are so dismissive, i believe steroids work in a lot of cases but it definitely feels a bit like if they don't, you're accused of ""not doing it right"". put pressure on your gp and don't give up! 

really hope it works out. drop me a pm sometime if you wanna talk about anything - i lost my dad in weird circumstances and it's hard to express to people how utterly mind-bendingly exhausting it is. no pressure at all of course... sending all the good vibes in the world. ðŸ˜Š"
"thank youðŸ’š they really do, i've always been prone to flare ups when stressed, but this stress is off the charts. you didn't sound dismissive! i definitely appreciate the honesty, and even if i do have to try something else first, it's good to be prepared for that! that's exactly it, steroids seem to be the ultimate treatment for most professionals, and the idea that they don't always work is somehow unfathomable to them.

thanks, i really appreciate it! ðŸ’š"
sounds like everyones dream here nice mate congratz! did you try dupixent aswell before?
i had same revelation with abricitinib until the monthly blood tests revealed it was messing with my liver and lowering my levels. these biological drugs seem great but its worth being cautious as they tend to come with side effects.
can you share your experience on the upadacitinib subreddit r/eczejaks too!?
"thanks a lot for sharing your experience ðŸ™ðŸ™.i am planning to get this medicine too for my severe eczema.

should i take it after food during day or night?"
hi have you noticed any side affects? i have severe eczema everywhere and really want to try this but im so worried about the side affects, i feel like it would be better than my eczema tho. also iâ€™ve heard it starts to stop working after a few months of taking it
hi, may i know are you still on the drug? if so, does it still working well for you and any side effects you experienced? thx
thanks! i actually had initially asked for dupixent as i had heard so many success stories from others with eczema but my dermo advised that upadacitinib is far more efficacious and works faster than dupixent. in the end i listened to my dermo and took upad and i am so glad i listened to him!
for sure! i agree that they may come with side effects but i think the benefit over cost is just too great for me. i will see how i go with my blood test in two months time. thanks for the heads up :)
yes sure thing!
hey sorry for the late reply. i recommend at night as it might make you drowsy
i have been on it since late oct and no side effects so far apart from pimples. look into dupixent as an alternative- much less risk of side effects! best of luck
"yep, still on it. i get minor flareups on my neck and arm folds during the week i get my period (ive had this pattern of flares before using rinvoq), otherise my skin is eczema free.

side effects include fatigue but drinking a bit of coffee helps with that. i also have a bit of acne but it's nothing compared to having a normal life again!"
thank you very much for replying ðŸ™
all good mate! i hope it works out for you

"rinvoq is life a life changer and worth the try. 
it helped me, a bit sad it went into plateau after a while. give it a go, maybe consider mtx as they go well together and increases the efficacy of rinvoq. 

all the best"
thank you i really hope it will work for me as well. it is very emotionally damaging to keep switching meds
i have used mtx and my liver couldn't take it sadly
"hi. i've been on dupixent (a monoclonal antibody) since the trial in 2012, that's 10 years. it has been my lifeline, clearing me completly within the first month of taking. i had ad since 2 years old, taken every topical known to pharma man, and ate prednisone like candy my whole life. at 67, my spine is painful- disintegrating and arthritic.
  
i dialed back the original script for every two weeks to taking 300 ml only once a month. still clear as a bell, just the usual random gritty feeling in my eyes, a very mild nuisance. tried to go 2 months without, and started to get that overall creeping feeling of inflammation we know too well. once a month is good for me.
  

  
i thought about switching to rinvoq (a jak inhibitor) because it could possibly help with my eczema and my arthritis, two conditions for the price of one pill (instead of an injection, which i don't mind at all).
  
but i dont like the idea that rinvoq helps with so many other different immune system conditions. makes me wonder... if my system is handling those other areas well, what happens when rinvoq (or cibinqo, etc) comes poking it's jak inhibiting nose into a pathway that already works just fine? anybody know?"
"it's better to go with dupilumab (a monoclonal antibody) because it has fewer side effects and is proven to work in people with ad. rinvoq is a jak inhibitor and has severe side effects like cancer, increased risk of major cardiovascular events, such as heart attack, stroke, or death especially if you're 50 years old, blood clots, tears in the stomach, and serious infections.

if dupilumab is not working for you then go for rinvoq."
">	iâ€™m not a fan of chemotherapy as a treatment

this is a common misconception when it comes to methotrexate.

yes, methotrexate is also used as a chemotherapy drug, but at significantly higher doses (500mg and up), and at such high doses methotrexate has cancer-fighting properties, by inhibiting a certain enzyme called dhfr, which ultimately inhibits dna/rna synthesis.

the dosages used on psa are typically 15-20mg. it turns out that at low doses, methotrexate behaves rather differently; instead of inhibiting dhfr, it inhibits certain t-cell interactions that are relevant to psoriasis. it's *not* a chemo drug at those dosages."
"i'm on rinvoq right now, much improved pain wise, i'd say 70% which is huge for me. 

i'd def recommend taking with a stomach protector, indigestion and nausea weren't as bad as they were on mtx but disappeared when i added one. 

minimal side effects so far, though (and sorry to be crass) i'm dealing with stomach and bowel issues today but hopefully will pass soon. 

patches on face almost complete cleared too!"
"a chemo agent is a chemo agent. i work in dermatology and we also use low dose injections to destroy, or reduce the size of, cancerous lesions (depending on the size). the class of drug is â€œanti metabolite antineoplasticâ€â€¦..so just because itâ€™s effective at low doses at surpressing your immune system without the toxic side effects doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s not still chemo and doesnâ€™t increase your risks for long term problems the same way a larger dose would, it just means it might take you slightly longer to get to those long term problems.


â€¦.and just so youâ€™re aware, that â€œpersonal reasonâ€ was my aunt *died* from long term use of methotrexate to treat her symptoms of sle."
hey just started rinvoq last week, how long did it take to see positive effects on your pain levels? my main symptom is wide spread enthesitis - wrists, knees, spine, etc
what is a stomach protector?
i don't understand why people defend methotrexate so much i mean yeah it heaps a little. the only reason my old rhuematologist prescribed it is because i had to fail starter meds!!
"i'd say maybe 3 weeks before i notices the patches clearing on my face, and that it wasn't such a struggle to get out of bed. 

i'm confident if i can add a good pain killer and physio for my muscles i will really benefit, but the stomach issues are kicking my arse to be fair."
any updates? howâ€™s your pain and enthesitis being managed by rinvoq?

"iâ€™m on rinvoq and yes had to make a bunch of annoying phone calls but now i have the copay card and it ships to my house. side effect-wise the first month i got zits/acne on my chest and a few tiny ones on my face, but in month two that started to improve. otherwise i cannot tell iâ€™m even taking anything, no other side effects but it also has not helped my ra yet either. fingers crossed that it starts working for me soon. 
i hope you have some good luck with this medicine, please keep us posted on if it helps you!"
"in australia so no idea about the payment stuff. 

the drug itself is good.been on it for 19 months now and it is working really well for me (i also take mtx and leflunomide) and kicked in pretty fast. about 3 days? don't skip doses, it doesn't really build up in the same way as mtx. 24 hours sans taking anything and my body gets stiff. 1 week without (covid vaccine) and i hated my existence again due to the pain.

i haven't had many noticeable side effects, or at least more than the usual ones. i do however notice that i think i am really good and run around, then with little warning abruptly need to sleep. so maybe be a bit wary of over doing things just because you feel good?

oh  and either the rinvoq or the leflunomide gives me zero alcohol tolerance. like, 3 sips and i am done sort of tolerance."
rinvoq + mtx put me in remission. never felt anything when missing a dose.
knocks out the itch of eczema within a couple hours and few days pass skin begins to calm and heal ... no difference in my arthritus but after a year on it i cant deal with the constant random violent diareah i have being on this that was compounded when they put me on lipitor a couple months ago i cant leav my house cause of this stuff .... if i miss more than 2 days the eczema fires up and i break out like crazy but i cant take this anymore ðŸ˜«
"i canâ€™t speak for rinvoq, but i take humira and the process is very similar. the copay card brings my cost down to $5/month and i heard from a nurse fairly frequently at the beginning. now i only hear from one if i need help with something (by my choosing, i also couldâ€™ve opted to continue having regular calls). so, no, itâ€™s not too good to be true! 

i hope it works for you and you get some relief and remission!"
iâ€™m in germany so thereâ€™s no copay card. i did develop an allergic reaction to it and was only on it for 3 weeks.
abbvie has one of the gold standard patient support programs in pharma, so itâ€™s not too good to be true!

i am in trial number lp0162-1326 for tralokinumab.  i am having amazing results!  it is obvious that i am receiving the drug and not a placebo because i am off all steroids and antihistamines and am eczema free!  the skin on my hands is soft and supple for the first time in my life!!
i was on the tralukinumab trial and received the four injections for the loading dose, very painful injections but worked like a miracle.unfortunately for me the trial was stopped for me for a reason i donâ€™t agree with but donâ€™t want to go into as i think itâ€™s in the interests of the trial that it is kept completely bias free. anyway i havenâ€™t been unblinded yet but given the amazing results that took about 3 days to start working. i am 100% sure i got the drug not the placebo. my easi score was 27 at the start and i had perfect skin after about a week. there is great hope everyone, hang in there.
"hey everyone,
so i've been on the tralokinumab trial for 18 weeks now. i'm pretty sure the first 16 weeks,  i was receiving the placebo as my skin worsened, but now i've been on the open label for a little over two weeks (just got my second set of injections last friday). anyways, since then, not much has changed. my hands seemed to have been doing better for a while but now they're the worst. i've started to peel a lot more fine flakes and i'm drying out a lot as well. it's gotten to the point where my hands hurt when i move them. i was planning to quit the trial today, but they told me that it's still too soon to tell, so i'm holding on. honestly, i feel like a lab rat being tested on at this point...

anyways, i'm on here to ask anyone who's on the same trial what their experience has been like? i read that some people had instantaneous results while others actually got worse before they got better and that it took months. i hope that maybe i'm the latter case? that maybe my ecza is worse because my body is just trying to get rid of all the damage? i don't know anymore."
"participated in the dupilumab trials in california two years ago, my dermatologist suggested it. 

had to call the clinical trial coordinator for my region and go through a screening process, the screening process took about 6-8 weeks before i got started in the phase 2b trial. 

the contact information can usually be found on clinicaltrials.gov"
how do you get to participate in such trials? and is there an age restriction? would toddlers who have a severe case of atopic dermatitis be permitted with parental consent?
"hey guys, for those of you on the tralokinumab trial... did the injections for the placebo vs the actual medicine feel different? i just got my first dose half an hour ago and i'm feeling like i got the actual drug. 

edit: also, i'm curious to know what people easi scores were and how quickly you noticed improvement. i've always down played my eczema quite a bit, but they rated me at a 36 on my first visit, which was kind jarring for me to hear considering you can get onto the trial with less than half that."
"i'm on dupixent (dupilumab) injections every 2 weeks. even though i'm not in the trial, my dermatologist *was one of the physicians working on the dupixent trials.*

he told me that when it came out he signed up as many severe atopic eczema patients as he could from his practice (19pts, 1 of which received placebo) into the trial. 

he looked at my patient intake photos (other dr. out on maternity) and said that i was exactly the type of patient that dupixent was made for.

you should see a dermatologist linked with a local university (ex. ucla dermatology) for your best chances at getting into a trial."
hi guys, i have just started on the trial and this is my second dose of medication but so far no noticeable results. still itchy, still flaky. as most posts have mentioned the injection is painful but nothing disastrous. i am just curious when did/do people start seeing noticeable differences? mine is all over my body and been very severe from the age of three and as most can understand i have really bad anxiety over it and scared it wont work and/or i'm on the placebo. i dont expect miracles overnight but i would like to know peoples feelings on when they could see and feel a difference - much love x
"i'm currently on week 10 in the tralokinumab clinical trial and i'm pretty sure that i'm receiving the placebo - the specialist doctors are also convinced that this is the case. my condition is out of control but i'm sticking to this because i only have another 6 weeks left until i recieve the actual drug ( 14 weeks down...im sure i can survive for another 6 weeks right?) 
my question is to those who believe that they are receiving the drug - how long did it take to show any improvements towards your condition (after the first set of injections)? i feel like i need to mentally prepare myself and not expect miracles after week 16."
how does one sign up for this?
"dupilumab update/news uk
we need your help!!!!

dupilumab has been initially rejected in the uk by the nhs as a treatment for atopic dermatitis/eczema. sanofi (the pharmaceutical provider of dupilumab) and nice (national institute for health and care excellence or board used by the nhs to approve new medicine) have asked for the wider community of eczema sufferers to come forward and provide comments so that the real-life impact of atopic dermatitis and treatment with dupilumab can be fully understood and assessed.

please help and submit your comments so the nhs and government can fully understand our struggle and pain and the impact it has on day-to day life but also psychologically and how it can ultimately shapes who are and become. personally eczema has led me to some very dark places with suicide a common thought at times and this drug must be made available to sufferers who want a safer more sustainable way of treating eczema long-term.

steps to do this:

please use the following link to access the nice website and read any materials necessary:

https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-ta10218/consultation/html-content

here you will need to register and sign up as a user to submit your comments, and only have until april 24th 2018 to do this.

below is a summary of the latest outcome from the appraisal and key points for your further information.

â€˜the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) has issued draft guidance rejecting sanofi/regeneronâ€™s dupixent (dupilumab) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in the uk.
the draft guidelines highlight that dupixent (dupilumab) is effective at treating moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (ad) following failure (or contraindication) of topical therapies and systemic immunosuppressant agents.
however, the institute said cost-effectiveness estimates for the drug were uncertain, and higher than that normally considered an acceptable use of nhs resources.â€™

key points to note at the next nice consultation:
Â· the appraisal committee will meet again to consider the evidence, this appraisal consultation document and comments from the consultees. Â· at that meeting, the committee will also consider comments made by people who are not consultees. Â· after considering these comments, the committee will prepare the final appraisal determination. Â· subject to any appeal by consultees, the final appraisal determination may be used as the basis for niceâ€™s guidance on using dupilumab in the nhs in england.

closing date for public comments: 24 april 2018

sanofi encouraged the following:

â€œwe encourage the atopic dermatitis and eczema community to review and comment on the guidance so that the real-life impact of atopic dermatitis and treatment with dupilumab can be fully understood and assessed.

please for any further information or assistance contact me on gurjbhamra@hotmail.co.uk"
is there evidence that jak/stat inhibitors do much for eczema?
awesome there is hope! thanks so much
i'm late, but i just got into a trial for lebrikizumab. it's ridiculous that my insurance won't approve dupixent, but i'm excited to at least try this drug class for free, even if it's only for 16 weeks.
a clinical trial was done on this all-natural hypoallergenic handmade soap and they found 93% efficacy in the results, which prompted me to try it and i cannot express how relieving(after literally 2 weeks of continuos use) it has been in respect to physical symptoms but also overall mental health. i feel soooo much better now that my skin is clear. hope it works for you as well!! :) they even have deals that bring down the cost if you get multiple, which it's an all-natural soap so doesn't hurt. srsly so happy my friend introduced this to me. please provide feedback to all those suffering here if you find relief too! www.eczedone.com
"hi
did you notice results straight away or it took time"
i was in the same trail for tralokinumab....it healed my hand...but not my body or face...well my body cleared up for a while then it's all come back...but i'm still in the trail and move to the open label section now. hopefully things get better soon...
how's the results going?
ayyy
"sorry to hear you aren't seeing any improvement yet. i'm not in the trial (though considering it), but given the experiences that others have shared here i think i would try to wait until after 3 months to see whether or not the treatment is effective.  

do you know if tralokinumab has a loading dose? dupilumab has 2 injections for the first week. if you were given placebo for the first 16 weeks, does that mean you did not get a loading dose? if that is the case, perhaps that could explain the slower response. this is just a guess. i hope you feel better soon."
hey i'm on the same trail...and i'm on open label as well now  because before week 14 everything was great then it's took a turn..so far it's not cleared yet, although somehow tralokinumab healed my hands...now my hands are totally free from eczema...but not my body nor my face and neck...so i'im still hoping this will work as dupixent haven't been public covered yet in canada..
there is a site on the sidebar https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=atopic+dermatitis&recr=open. the results can be filtered by age and geographic location. there are contacts/locations listed that you can try to contact.
i just received my week 14 injections a week ago, and i'm pretty certain i'm on the drug.  injections have been painful all along, and i'm fairly pain tolerant, but i don't know how different they are from placebo because i haven't knowingly received placebo yet.  i have had injection site reactions the last two doses and i don't know if that happens with placebo.  next week i'll start the maintenance phase at week 16, so i may be able to tell a difference if i end up on placebo or half placebo arms for the trial.  i started baseline with an easi score of 30.04 and am now at 4, though i missed my week 12 dose due to traveling.  after the loading dose at baseline, i saw some effects right away, even the same day.  and overall there has been improvement every week.  i'm mostly clear except for some residual rash on my neck, which has also improved but is not clear.  i'm actually happy i'm not clear to start week 16, as i learned that at my current score, i'm considered to have hit the trial target, but i only need to worsen a couple of points in order to be transferred to open label in case i end up on a placebo arm, whereas if i am clear at week 16, it's a bigger delta of worsening before transferring.  at least, that's how it was described to me.  wish me luck for next week!!
iâ€™m on dupixent and it took a few weeks to really show some impact.
it took 2 months for me to really start seeing the massive improvements both psychically and mentally when it came to not having to scratch certain spots anymore. it took some time. i had some flakyness for a solid 3 months after i started the injection. but it wasn't a very scratchy flakyness.
i just got my loading dose yesterday for the tralokinumab trial.  my condition after not using protopic and steroid creams for 2 weeks was so bad that they said for now, i can use those creams and they also gave me kefflex (antibiotic).  i saw in one of your previous posts that they said you may be delayed or kicked out if you use steroid creams.  if your condition is severe enough, they should allow you what they allowed me.  you need to let them know that you aren't able to go to work or unable to sleep and in constant pain etc.  it's hard to believe that they will not let you use creams to temporarily control the severity until week 16.  and also, everybody's reactions are different, some will see improvement within a week, some may not see any improvement for months.
there is a site on the sidebar https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=atopic+dermatitis&recr=open. the results can be filtered by age and geographic location. there are contacts/locations listed that you can try to contact.
blows my mind that anyone would deny this. you hit the nail on the head, there needs to be better understanding of the impact of eczema on people.
"yes. drugs are still in clinical trial for larger scale safety and efficacy studies for long-term use. two jak inhibitors have received breakthrough therapy designations from the fda, which should reduce the time for them to reach the us market should clinical trials go well.  

http://dermatologytimes.modernmedicine.com/dermatology-times/news/aad-meeting-preview-atopic-dermatitis-treatments"
yes, i'm in the upadacitinib trial which is a jak inhibitor,  and it's a terrific drug.  highly effective against eczema.
keep working on your insurance .it is all about the paperwork and showing them that you have tried everything else and it failed.  need to show that you have been through steroids, broad immune suppressors, light therapy, etc..
tralokinumab has a loading dose of 4 shots. subsequent ones are just 2 shots.  the "loading dose" could be 4 shots of just normal saline if you were in the placebo group.
thank you. was not aware of it.
just an update - i got my week 16 injections on the 9th, and so far it seems that i was given the drug again, so i may not be on the placebo arm of the maintenance phase.  next week's dose may tell whether i'm on full drug or half drug/half placebo.  i feel very fortunate already, but hoping for the best.
and which drug are you on?  this thread is about multiple drugs, so that info would help, as we aren't all talking about the same thing.
"thanks for your reply :)
are you still on it?
are you healed?
its the unknown i guess that is knawing at me. people have said you are on the medication if the injection hurt but not sure about that."
"hi how long did you 1st notice there was a difference in your itching.  i had my 1st  4 shots last week and the itching has been so intense.  i'm so down as i was hoping for some relief.
just wondering when people noticed a relief from the horrible itch so i can feel like there's still hope and i'm not stuck on the placebo! ðŸ™ˆðŸ˜”ðŸ˜•"
"i've just had my week 12 dose. obviously no change again. they've told me that i was allowed topical steroids but that i'd  have to have a few weeks drug free before i started the dosages again. for me, i was a little hesitant because i didn't want to risk feeling this way again and also delaying my trial. how would it be guaranteed that i wouldn't be back to square one during the  2 weeks i needed to be clear of topical steroids? so i've decided to continue. i've got one more left before they give me the real drug. so fingers crossed :)
are you based in the uk? just curious how your clinical team have been with you. mine aren't too supportive compared to how other patients have had their experiences."
thanks. will check it out.
i tried again after reading this and was approved officially this morning. :]
i'm on the tralokinumab trial
"oh sorry, thought this was a dupixent thread.

dupixent is what i'm talking about."
"yeah still on it currently. uh the unknown is still unknown. i've been following the study for awhile & nothing serious has came up. the only reaction i've personally had is very slight swollen eyelids. nothing horrible since you can just rinse your face with hot water and it fixes that. 

the actually medication itself differs. the thigh doesn't hurt much. in addition, if you inject it slowly rather than quickly, it's virtually painless. it's not as painful as others say imo. i expected much worse initially with my needles phobia haha."
you don't say which trial you are on.  are you on a monoclonal antibody or a jak inhibitor?  i ask because the op mentions jak inhibitors and those are oral as opposed to an injectable like the mabs.
for me it was close to two months that i started seeing a lot of improvement when it came to itching. even then it still dragged itself along (not as bad) for a month after even. so it can probably take awhile. i wouldn't worry too much. probably just give it some time.
"i am based in canada. i wasn't covered for dupixent and can't afford it which is why im doing the trial. honestly you can use the steroid cream mildly and just not tell them. you can use it for lets say the first week and then stop using the second week before going into see them. the team here has been good i guess. they said you were going to go on open
 label?"
glad to hear. i hope it is as beneficial for you as it has been for me.
ah, okay.  i'm also on a tralokinumab trial, 10 weeks in.  it's working well for me.  i noticed some results right away, but it's been mostly slow and steady for me.  i think the response varies a fair amount between individuals.
thanks for the reply :) heres hoping i am on the drug! my eczema has really been playing up the past month due to the crazy weather in melbourne. really waiting on some relief from this crap! i guess will see what the next couple ot months unfold :)
thanks for the i'll just hang in there and not feel despondent thinking that i'm on the placebo!
"i heard that the dupixent  has had great success although it won't be covered under our national health service, at least before september 2018, because of cost-effectiveness  and funding issues. 
i guess i could use the topical steriods. but i'm not sure. many people have told me to but i guess it's just that moral issue in me (although they're not really supporting me themselves). 
yes, they have told me that i will probably be going to an open label because no improvements or differences have been detected in my condition. i'm just wondering how long it'll take for any improvements to be seen in my condition - just so that i'm mentally prepared and don't expect too much after my first dosage."
good to know. this coming thursday is my 3rd round. so far no difference..still itchy and no signs of improvement
there was no improvement in my daughter during the double blind phase of the tralokinumab study, so we think she was most likely on the placebo. her condition worsened terribly after she came off the steroid creams but she hung on without taking the steroid creams. she was put in the open label study after 16 weeks and it took about a month to notice a significant improvement. no more skin lesions, no more blood on the sheets in the morning, less itchy, better sleep.
"i'm currently on the open label for the tralokinumab study too. i was most probably on the placebo for the first 16 weeks (according to the clinicians and doctors). my condition was horrendous and debilitating. i had my first injection last week (of the drug) and i haven't noticed a significant improvement.
i'm surprised that some have seen an improvement after such a short amount of time  so i guess it's a bit of a relief that i'm not the only one that is waiting so long to see an improvement."
hi, i've been wondering if the folks who get transferred to open label after week 16 get a loading dose (4 injections), or if they start on open label with just the normal 2 injections dose?  i think the loading dose definitely makes a difference in how quickly one will see results.  if you got a normal dose instead of a loading dose, you may have to wait longer for significant improvement.  hang in there; i hope you start seeing results soon!
hi. i'm on the open label and i only received the normal 2 injections. i'm based in the uk so i'm not sure if that differs depending on where you are based but i don't think it will.
am on day 4.
in exactly where you are ready to start how@cone youeft the chat
i know it's too early to tell any improvements, but could you tell me how affected was your skin before you started it?
what did you end up doing? i am on xeljanz the last 2 years but may switch over to rinvoq as i have not had growth the last 6-7 months and am losing hair. let me know
hey! sorry about that. iâ€™m on rinvoq currently. let me know what questions you have :)
wondering if you could provide an update. have you had any success with hair regrowth on rinvoq? what is your current dose? have you or are you experiencing any side effects? i recently got approved to start rinvoq and will be receiving my first bottle soon. i suffer from eczema, prurigo nodularis and alopecia areata. hoping to kill 3 birds with one stone.
how did rinvoq end up going for you? i am going to start next week for alopecia.
hi there! you might consider cross posting to r/eczemabs
"also r/eczejaks , a sub new to me until just now.

best!"
"1. yes.
2. your eczema will come back.
3. increased blood clots, weakened immune system, and slight risk of lymphatic cancer iirc. i personally have noticed absolutely no side effects while on it though and i just hit a month."
1. hopefully topical jak inhibitors will work just as good if not better than the pills and have much less side effects
we'll see, but i doubt it, tbh.
topical tofacitinib words excellently for alopecia areata. all kinds of jak inhibitors are in pipeline: oral, inhaled, intranasal and topical.
"tralokinumab is in phase 3 trial and might get approved in 1-2 years. it doesn't have the eye side effects like dupilumab.
that's all i know atm"
donâ€™t quote me on this, but as i recall upa had a lot more side effects
i can full on tell you that no, it is not way better that dupilumab at all. i bought into that hype as well and it honestly works less than cyclosporine. i'm on upadacitinib and dupilumab simultaneously after stopping the combo of cyclosporine and dupilumab and it's working much less, but having been on cyclosporine for so long i had to get off of it. i'm hoping that it increases in efficacy as i'm only around week 3, but sadly, i don't really see it doing that.
it has a lot more reported side effects solely due to it being a jak inhibitor so it has all of the same warnings that all jak inhibitors have as a result of some rare freak stuff with xeljanz. i've noticed absolutely no side effects on rinvoq so far vs having side effects with dupixent.
"i was on dup for around a year, it cleared 60% of my skin, but facial flare and red eye lid. i switched to rinvoq for around 2 months now, it cleared almost 95%. so far so good.

i am fking scared about the side effects too, but there's no better option.

i will continue on rinvoq until my body cannot handle it."
i'm on rinvoq 15mg tabs once daily and it's improved my symptoms significantly. it's a good medication if you ask me, hope all goes well with you starting it and that you find relief
how has it been going now that you're a few months in? do you take anything else with it?
pretty instant. that said i've been considering just getting off of it as it's kind of more of a daily maintenance med and i can tell the dupixent i'm on is doing all of the heavy lifting.
i was in the phase 2 trial and i knew i has received the drug, and not the placebo,  about 30 minutes after i took the first pill.  the drug worked incredibly well.
how did you get on both at the sane time?? isnt upadacitinib still on trial???
just took my second pill. for me the itching stops in about 45 minutes. pretty incredible!
no, itâ€™s available in the us as rinvoq. iâ€™m on it off label.
there's a lot of hope now for eczema patients going forward, a bunch of drugs that will be on the market starting in 2021 and more following later.  i have participated in a number of trials at mt sinai in new york,  my dermatologist oversees the trials and i ask her many questions in my appointments.  upadacitinib (rinvoq) will almost certainly be approved in early 2021, and the pfizer jak1 inhibitor is as good a drug as upa and should beat upa to market by several months.  the. dermira monoclonal antibody which is in the drug class similar to dupixent is possible for 2022, and in the phase 2 data showed that it reduced itch remarkably quickly and much more quickly than dupixent.  there are other drugs that show promise too.
lucky iâ€™m in canada and itâ€™s still on trial... canadian free hella th care not that good sometimes
so what would this cost us in canada. it says it is a 59,000 yearly cost which i presume is u.s. estimates
"not gonna lie, i spent way too long looking at that word trying to decide if it was some sort of new â€œupdawgâ€ joke.

let us know how it goes if you end up taking it."
any word on how you've been doing on this?
hi! sorry i'm a little late to this. i went through the study and stayed on the medication the whole 3 years i was allowed (1 year study, 2 years open label) and it is honest to god the only thing that has ever worked for me. i've been on all of the biologics and numerous other things with no luck. i didn't feel completely better, but i was able to achieve endoscopic remission. i didn't really have any side effects, except maybe a few headaches. and after i stopped the medicine (& started on entyvio then) i got extremely sick again because i no longer had the upadacitinib. it wasn't like withdrawal or anything, just going off of the only thing that ever helped. and i know we're all different people and it's not going to work for everyone, but i would highly recommend giving it a try! let me know if you have any other questions :)
unfortunately i got kicked out of the study because my hemoglobin was too low. if you're looking into going on it then i hope everything works out for you. it looks promising.
thank you so much! glad to hear it was great for you. that was like when i took rhb-104. worked wonders for me but couldnâ€™t stay on it past the initial year unfortunately. iâ€™ve got a colonoscopy in a few days and then after that iâ€™m starting upadacitinib. so excited! i donâ€™t really have any questions since iâ€™ve gotten them all pretty much answered by the research place iâ€™m getting it from. only thing that really concerned me was the blood clots but then i read that people with ra are more prone to blood clots so i assumed thatâ€™s where that came from. it was only a very small amount of people too.
oh that's awesome, i'm so happy for you that you get to start it soon!! yeah i never had an issue with blood clots or anything, and if i remember correctly the list they gave me of side effects was very short. to be fair, i did start it 3 & a half years ago and they didn't have as much info back then, but still. i'm really hoping it gets approved and becomes available someday. i wish you the best of luck!
considering itâ€™s abbvie, i wouldnâ€™t be surprised if it eventually does get approved. hang in there! :)
there are a bunch of people in the trial on /r/eczemabs and you can sort by the clinical trial flair
no answer to your third question, but iâ€™d be very surprised if it had a permanent effect. ultimately it depends on the cause of your eczema but chances are itâ€™s just a treatment and will work as long as you take it. if clearing it up while you are on the medication allows you to more easily make other life changes that help, you might still be better off afterward
how would we know any of these answers?  itâ€™s a trial, not available yet.
it's been around for awhile the trial, i'm sure there are people on this thread who are or been in it.
it's available as rinvoq in the us. been on it for a full month now with a regular script even.

i started rinvoq at the beginning of february. in 4 weeks my inflammation markers were half what they were. i am also on mtx (switched from xeljanz to the rincoq). literally the only side effect i experience is full body acne. it's like i'm 16 again. but... better than pain. so this was a game changer for me. i hope it works as well for you!
been on rinvoq for a few months, my inflammatory markers were both normal for the first time since i was diagnosed. it's been working wonders so far
2019?

too bad its a drug that's highly expensive without insurance and even with to where you need those copay cards. still, this might help them figure out what exactly truly causes the issue and create an inexpensive drug that's safe long term
"seems really promising, also easier mechanism than dupilumab (oral vs. injectable). 

would participate in this trial in a heartbeat. so hard to get an appointment with dr. guttman though, been trying for ages."
i wonder if it would ever become available in the uk.

">why can't they just admit that uc is not curable

i don't live in the us, but based on the impression i get from this sub, the patients and doctors are well aware, that there is no cure. the only thing you can do is treat the symptoms and get people in remission. if you don't do this, they will die eventually. so treating the symptoms seems reasonable.


there is no difference in europe regarding the treatment option and success btw. only the costs vary, as in the us the insurance system is different and the drugs are insanely expensive."
huh? i've been in remission for a few years thanks to modern medicine. if you can find the right combo, it does work ðŸ¤·ðŸ¼â€â™€ï¸ i live a normal life because of access to these drugs.
i donâ€™t understand this post. these may not work for everybody, but they sure did work for me. currently symptoms-free since january 2021 with biologics. started working a week after my first injection. of course they are not a cure, iâ€™m well aware. as long as i can live a normal life iâ€™m ok with that. and yes, iâ€™m fortunate enough that i seem to be able to eat anything without consequences. do i dread the day they stop working for me? also yes. in the meantime, iâ€™ll keep taking them.
"yes they know uc is not curable since they donâ€™t know how it is triggered. see uc is random, some people will have very long years of remission such as 15+ years on literally nothing but diet changes and mesalamine and some will need heavier drugs that block the immune cells inflammatory signals.

then thereâ€™s also herbal medicines such as curricumin and qing dai and probiotics with supplementations that are coming into spotlight. they are discovering many ways to bring people into remission, and most people are mild and will only stay on mesalamine. so itâ€™s hopeful to say they might find something with very high remission rates such thatâ€™s itâ€™s literally a cure"
please explain why you believe uc medications increase the symptoms. are you saying they just donâ€™t work or are you saying they actually make symptoms worse?
"huh? everyone knows uc is not curable friend.however, being a complex polygenic disease, we all have different phenotypes. that means, we might have same symptoms and same disease, but the exact mechanism (and severity) varies from person to person. which means the medication that will help them will differ.

for a good portion of people, one of these treatments will work - and not necessarily the first one they try. for a small (but significant) portion of people, nothing currently available will work. some lucky buggers go into full remission with just mesalamine for example. and some people will have no choice but surgery. worse still, we know that even if you do go into remission with biologics, eventually at some point your body will develop antibodies and it will no longer be effective, and we're living life hoping for the next advance in medicine.

i would not say europe has greater availability of biologics than the us. in fact, based on my experiences with family members trying to get meds for other illnesses and talking to people in the us about this, it's easier for them to get the state of the art treatment. the only difference is they have gold plated insurance - and if you don't you're fucked and can't get it at all or go broke. whereas, it might take us a bit longer but we get it for free. this is not a debate about the disease, but about capitalist vs socialist-style healthcare systems (nowhere in europe is actually truly socialist). i agree with you, nobody should have to live in crippling pain and debt because of a disease that has medications that can reduce those symptoms, especially when they live in a country as wealthy as the usa. one that is able to just hand out 10s of billions to other countries, and spend 100s of billions on weapons/war."
"we all know its not curable. but at least i dont have to leave in fear of affording my meds.

my colonoscopy cost me nothing, 0, and even if i had to pay for it it would have been 300 dolars in a private facility with everything included, and about 200 without going under.

i take mesalamine suppositories and pills. they cost me 4 dollars a month total.

the reason we like health care is becouse we can afford it. so doctors actually give us treatment that tries to do more then just keep us alive. it will not always work but unlike us i will not go into debt for trying."
"hey friend, uc is a miserable, largely misunderstood disease that has no cure. those should be the first things any doctor tells you. i was diagnosed at 8 and that was basically what they told me, plus the usual â€œhopefully in your lifetime weâ€™ll find a cureâ€ crap. but it is *possible* for it to be manageable with drugs. it is also possible that without a colon your symptoms vanish, but even that isnâ€™t a certainty. 

the thing about biologics is that they are now the first and last line of defense. if you fail them, modern medicine has no other options besides taking out your colon. 

before biologics, 5-asaâ€™s (which it seems youâ€™ve been introduced to already) were the first line of defense. 5-asaâ€™s are mesalamine, sulfasalazine, etc. while their safety profile is excellent (99.9% tolerate it, iâ€™m in the 0.01% who have an allergy to it which makes my symptoms aggressively worse), when they were the first line of defense treatment about 20% of patients with uc needed a colectomy and 30% required a colectomy within a year of their first hospitalization. since the introduction of biologics, those rates have declined to 5.3 and 11.9%; significant, but no 0. also, some of the name brand 5-asaâ€™s are miserably expensive as youâ€™ve learned. the thing that biologics do that 5-asaâ€™s donâ€™t is induce mucosal healing, which is now the gold standard for measuring efficacy of treatment. 

with how important biologics are, mercifully there are more biologics than there used to be: anti tnf (anything derived from remicade), integrin blockers (entyvio), il-23 inhibitors (skyrizi/stelara), jak inhibitors (veljanz, jyseleca, rinvoq), and s1p inhibitors (zeposia).

the numbers from studies bear out that they are by and large safe, basically doubling your risk at cancer from 1 in 10,000 in general pop to 2 in 10,000. offhand i donâ€™t remember the numbers anymore but being in a flare typically raises the risk of complications or of losing your colon or colon cancer exponentially in comparison (thereâ€™s a 30% number hanging around in my head). 

but you have to find a biologic that works, they can be ungodly expensive, and while generally safe, any one is effective for between 40 and 60% of patients. hence why having a bunch of mechanisms to try is important, it brings the number of patients it can help up significantly. 

now, the cynic in me says, the numbers are all funded by the people making many millions more than they used to off of just 5-asaâ€™s. but we have strikingly few options in modern medicine unless you want to just have your colon out and hopefully that does the trick. 

personally, i suspect due to the incredible variance between effective treatments, a large part of the problem is that the term ulcerative colitis is an umbrella term for a large collection of underlying diseases with similar presentation but different causes. if what your body is doing thatâ€™s causing the issue (which also seems to vary from flare to flare) doesnâ€™t fall into one of the very few categories there are drugs to treat, youâ€™re out of luck. 

i canâ€™t say anything about europe and european insurance, but i would hope that the programs these companies run for co-pay assistance exist over there. maybe look into that if you havenâ€™t, assuming you have some kind of insurance. frankly though the sticker cost of both manufacturing and administering biologics are criminal. 

ulcerative colitis can be a disability, i would imagine/hope thatâ€™s easier in europe than in the us. itâ€™s bitterly difficult to get on in the us despite how severely limiting the disease even when mild can be. 

because it sounds as though you are struggling and youâ€™re in italy, iâ€™ll offer two things that in my experience i have previously found effective. the first is mutaflor, itâ€™s a first line of defense drug in the rest of the world (unavailable in the us due to the e. coli scare in 2013) and relatively cheap. itâ€™s a beneficial strain of e. coli, nissle. 

the second is even cheaper and is made in italy: zacol nmx, theyâ€™re these giant shellac pills that contain butyric acid. the limited science that exists on comparing healthy peopleâ€™s gut microbiomes to ours shows that thereâ€™s an entire strain missing from our guts, unfortunately i donâ€™t remember the name offhand. but this strain feeds on butyric acid, and adding their food directly to the large intestine (butyric acid gets destroyed/digested in the stomach/small intestine but this gut bacteria lives in the large intestine) seems to increase their presence and to help bring the disease down. 

iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re going through it. if youâ€™re done with modern medicine and trying to keep your colon, if you can both somehow identify and afford a truly good healer, whether traditional chinese medicine and acupuncture, or some other methodology, it can be worth trying. iâ€™ve been having incredible results with a combination of acupuncture and biologics. but it really does require someone incredibly skilled to help us. 

best of luck to you. 

oh, and to simply answer your question about biologic availability jealousy, theyâ€™re the only medicine we have so any limitations on getting access to them is one fewer option before surgery."
cure would indicate you take it for a short period and then never need it again.
no one ever stated uc is curable apart from surgery. all the meds are to control symptoms and not to cure you at this moment.
without modern medicine i'd be dead by now.
if you don't take meds your uc gets worse. if your uc gets worse you get cancer. if you get cancer you die. so by inductive reasoning (because these are documented patterns that support a specific conclusion), if you don't take your uc meds, you will die. you can't cure this, not yet. i'm not in remission yet, but i have been on said drugs and noticed an improvement in my symptoms. i'm not even an adult yet and i've had to deal with anxiety, ocd, an autoimmune illness, and i've done it all while maintaining good grades in school and saving up money for college. you take your shit and you live with it, i'm sorry if i sound like an asshole, but you can only change the things that are within your control, like your attitude towards this illness. is there glory in sucking it up? no, but from my experience it keeps you from going insane. i'm not invalidating you or your experience, but you can't move on from what you are going through right now if you don't change your mentality and change your plan.
been completely in remission since late 2017 because of infliximab. prior to that was in flare to some extent more than half the time for a decade. it was an absolute miracle for me. wherever you got your information, discard it. for some people biologics are effective beyond what we believed possible.
entyvio put me in remission, am i cured? no. am i able to eat without intense pain and discomfort? yes. am i dying? i mean i guess, just like everyone else, but not because of my uc. i have bad days, but for the most part, i can do anything anyone else can, i just have to get infusions. there is no denying healthcare cost is a serious issue, but it does get better, eventually.
as someone who tried 5 different biologics and had none of them work, i know first hand what it's like to have medications fail. medications failing in my case wasn't the meds fault, i had a particularly aggressive form of uc but i have known many people who it does work. i ended up getting a colectomy in august. even though medication did not work for me, i still believe it can work and it does for most people. it took over 4 years of trying meds before i had surgery. i honestly hope you do find something that will help but saying that we should give up is not the answer. giving up will kill you. i hope you are able to get a more positive outlook, i know that can be hard but it would help with dealing with this if you did.
"maybe this group is not the best place to vent about how you feel because people are more â€œrationalâ€.

you are valid and your emotions too. we all know itâ€™s hard to find a good treatment and itâ€™s a long way to accept the daily frustration of restriction with food and the isolation of all of this. the risks of being homeless because you canâ€™t work. this feeling of being out of the society, the normal world, this is a real struggle. 
you are right in a certain way about european healthcare system (even if itâ€™s different to every country in europe) because people are protected if they have a chronic disease with good insurance to pay all the treatments, and in france for exemple you can have money every months if you are disabled by your flares. 

but the treatments are not better or very different and if you donâ€™t find a good treatment for you it will not be different in europe.

however, itâ€™s very important for you to manage your stress and try to find things who works for you. itâ€™s not because no study prove that things helped that nothing helps. every body is different. in my experience if i have an anti-inflammatory diet (which i have before for endometriosis) and if i eat organic food and if i take chinese herbs it helps. itâ€™s not a treatment, itâ€™s not magical, but it helps. i do a lot of meditation and yoga to be able to manage my emotions and my stress, and i had to go to therapy to have tools to live a life with multiple chronic diseases. iâ€™m young and my life change forever and thatâ€™s okay. but itâ€™s a long process physically and mentally. iâ€™m so sorry you have to deal with this."
"theyre jealous because ours are essentially free with no out of pocket costs. 

plus remission may not be a cure but feels great."
does the healthcare system in italy pay for your medications? it sounds like youâ€™re saying it doesnâ€™t.
"i suspect that we will eventually find the uc is actually a number of different diseases.   some genetic, some autoimmune, some an infection like h. pylori, some environmental.  

fwiw, i got sick in the uk and had an emergency colectomy there.  i was treated by us military, nhs, and private doctors on harley street.  my experience with the nhs was a nightmare.  the treatment plan was the same but the quality of care was different."
">the only thing you can do is treat the symptoms and get people in remission. if you don't do this, they will die eventually. so treating the symptoms seems reasonable.

then shouldn't we stop taking biologics? all they do is increase the symptoms and make it much harder to survive without a job."
[deleted]
guess i'm the most unlucky person on earth then
in my case, they made the symptoms worse. so imagine how it feels when everyone tells you they are the cure.
"so this is 0.0005% odds out of 30000 people. that's 0.15. i am literally unique to this sub.

if those two don't work i'll just chalk it up as colectomy. i'm tired of risking homelessness."
you'll die without them. *die.* job won't matter when you're dead.
if biologics made the symptoms worse then no one would take them. they help us get into remission and stay there. if they don't work for you you'll need to try other medications until something works. best of luck.
"i've been in remission for two years now, and yes, i can drink alcohol, eat fast food and sugary drinks - i just choose not to. i can eat candy and chocolate as well, and dairy, and... 

and i'm not even on a biologic, i'm on mesalazine.

uc may not be cureable but with a bit of luck it's *manageable.*"
are booze and mcdoubles really what you use to measure quality of life?
yes.
i can do all that thanks to remicade even though i was hospitalized with severe pancolitis last year.
i reckon the majority of people that reach remission can probably do all this stuff
i was in remission 20 years and could do all those things
yep, on humira and i can do all of the above. i can also eat nuts, seeds  and salads.
as someone else has said you need to change your attitude a bit, weâ€™re all hard done by in some way but most of us try keep positive that things will get better otherwise whatâ€™s the point?
there are 31k equally unlucky people in this sub. weâ€™re all painfully aware how incurable the disease is and how severe side effects the meds can have.
if someone told you that a biological is a cure they were lying to you. there is no cure. but biologics arenâ€™t the only option to treat your symptoms. when i was diagnosed i was put on mesalamine it instantly made my symptoms worse, way worse. but i was quickly switched to another kind of drug and that eventually got me to maintain remission. if biologics arenâ€™t working try another category of drug.
i think what you are implying is they didn't work, not that the drug itself made it worse.  uc is an autoimmune disease where you immune system thinks something is wrong in your small intestine and send white blood cells to go and attack the problem. because there is no problem they end up attacking the intestine walls causing the ulcers.  there is no cure because once the immune system thinks there is a problem, it does not switch off.  however, certain drugs for certain people can stop the white blood cell from being deployed and attacking the intestine walls. different drugs work different ways at different stages in the cycle.  stelera for example stops a certain messenger protine from reaching the immune system and then activating the t cells.  but it doesn't work for everyone, and 2% of patients develop antibodies to the drug. those patients who the drug does not work for will continue to experience symptoms and could get worse since nothing is actually treating the problem.  but the drug isn't cause the problems to get worse, the autoimmune disease itself is causing the issue to get worse.
yeah, thereâ€™s unfortunately a lot of that type of uniqueness with this disease. iâ€™m sorry to hear that. hopefully one or both of those help and/or some other option for affordability opens up for you. no one should have to risk homelessness to get treatment.
by the time i find a medication that works my body will be so crippled by all the medications i took that i won't be able to walk. luck is the one thing i do *not* have.
a true american.
"last time someone told me to ""change attitude"" for 20 years in a row, i discovered i was diagnosed with psychomotory retardation (since i was born), borderline personality disorder, and schizoid personality disorder that entire time and absolutely no one told me, and i sued them to absolute oblivion.

but you're right. i guess i just despise people who aren't genetic failures and make finding a cure immediately look so easy."
good, because subtlehame literally just claimed half an hour ago that biologics do not have any side effects whatosever and they can cure it.
"i'm going to give you some advice. change your attitude. uc sucks, everyone here knows that. many people have had to try countless different types of medication in order to find one that works, you're not special in that regard. 

your idea that you might as well not treat this serious disease is actually a little childish, not to mention insulting to the rest of us who have had to go through long and difficult periods before arriving at an acceptable quality of life.

you're also straight up not making sense. you say your body will crippled by medication? you think your body won't be crippled by untreated uc? modern biologics don't really have side effects so i dunno where you got that from."
jak inhibitors are a step in the right direction, especially the more targeted ones. the challenge is that their entire profile suppresses the immune system and, therefore, presents the possibility of the development of malignancies and other things. again, the science is marching toward better treatment options and we should be happy about that. however, if the black box warning lists cancer as a possible side effect, i'm happy to keep my vitiligo. some risk? sign me up. major risks? nah i'm good.
yeah im not sure oral jak inhibitors will ever be a real solution, happy to stick with topicals though

"i have been on rinvoq upadacitinib (45mg) for 10 months now after mtx, humira, simponi, etanercept and jyseleca (filgotinib) didn't work properly or only for short time.

from what i've heard, rituximab is more intense as it wipes out your b-cells (please correct if wrong) so you will be very prone to infections. upadacitinib is more on the same infection risk level as the other biologics.

rinvoq has been really great, only downside is weight gain and acne but being almost pain-free is a good trade-off."
"i'm going into biologic #3, and unfortunately it's more common than you'd think. but it's not as scary, either!

when the first one failed it really threw me for a loop. i had already ""failed"" mtx. when enbrel stopped working i thought i was doomed. i brought this up at my appt, and my rheumy wrote out a chart with all the possibilities. there are so many bios on the market. according to [the arthritis foundation ](https://www.arthritis.org/drug-guide/biologics/biologics), there are 5 types: ""tumor necrosis factor-Î± (tnf) inhibitors, b-cell inhibitors, interleukin inhibitors, selective co-stimulation modulators, and monoclonal antibodies"". each category has different options, too! 

plus, treatment plans are all about the combos. in my last appt, my new rheumy told me that developing an effective treatment plan is nothing but trial and error. that's very disconcerting, but imagine having ra 25 years ago when there weren't any biologics! 

don't worry too much; mental/emotional stress can make you flare-y. as difficult as things are atm, you're moving forward to find what works ðŸ€"
my mother started taking upadacitinib now. she started with mtx got bad lung infection then tried sulfasalazine with prednisolone (did not work at all), then one more treatment i forgot about. now she is taking upadacitinib for one month. she started feeling better after 1 week but she is taking prednisolone with it.
thank you all for the replies ðŸ¥° i decided to go for updacitinib for now ðŸ§šðŸ¼â€â™€ï¸
"iâ€™m on filgotinib (jyseleca) which, similarly to rinvoq is a selective jak inhibitor. it was also the first med in many years that finally put me in remission.
iâ€™ve not had any infections or otherwise since i started in october, so canâ€™t relate there. with that said, you may want to speak with your doctor about your illnesses and see if there is something to be done. likely little to do except stop the med though. if thatâ€™s the case youâ€™ll have to determine whether the possible return to flaring is worth the infections. to further muddy this choice is that you have likely been on most treatments already without success. iâ€™m guessing youâ€™ve been on the various types of biologics and now a jak inhibitor. how about s1p antagonists like ozanimod or estramod? 

 if no med works, and you donâ€™t want to deal with the infections then perhaps look into surgery? 

only you can determine whatâ€™s right for you. 

also just a short note, rinvoq is not a biologic. biologics are produced from living organisms, are liquid so taken by infusion or injection and the drug name with end in -mab. i mention this because it might avoid some confusion when discussing with your gi."
"what were those 4 infections? and how old are you? 

what does feeling slightly unwell mean? like feverish or tired or drowsy? have you checked you vitamin and haemoglobin levels?"
did you try 15mg first? it can be prescribed at 15mg. it might be worth asking your doctor about stepping down to 15mg. that would suppress your immune system less, making you less susceptible to infections but more susceptible to a flare.  sounds like it might be worth it in your case. the manufacturer does recommend to "use the lowest effective dose needed to maintain response".
"i am becoming more and more ok with the idea of surgery. on top of that the thought of being on immunosuppressants for the rest of my life (i'm 24) sounds grim. if it's likely i'll need to get my colon removed one day i might aswell just do it now...that's what i'm thinking anyway. 

there are still a few more biologics to try but i don't even know if i want to anymore ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ id happily try reducing the dose but i'm running out of willpower to try treatments."
"24 years old. i had c.diff, covid and 2 other colds on separate occasions (one currently)

feeling unwell, meaning feverish and fatigued. my haemo levels are fine but not checked my vit levels.."
not tried 15mg. i started on 45, then moved down to and stayed on 30. this is a great idea, i'll definitely be asking to try 15 and see if i can start to feel better. i can't lie, if i had to choose between flaring up or feeling unwell all the time.....i think i'd prefer flaring up â˜ ï¸ i can deal with pain but the fatigue and fever makes me not want to do anything ever
yeah thatâ€™s not an uncommon path either, and much down to personal preference. i prefer exhausting all medications before surgery, but can definitely see the appeal of just getting it over with. read up on the surgery and talk with your gi about it. best of luck!
did your infections cause a flare?
great advice, i will be doing exactly that, thankyou;))
surprisingly no, the flare that was under control in feb has pretty much stayed in control until now even with all the infections
thatâ€™s nice! i was on my first remission since ever on rinvoq and then got covid. 3 days later i was on the verge of getting hospitalised again. now on 60mg of prednisone hoping for the best. i wanna eat shawarama though but red meat is too much to digest rn ðŸ¤£
ahaha ikwym! one of the good things about being in hospital on iv steroids is i basically eat whatever i want without consequence â˜ ï¸  so there's that!
it's been a wonder drug for a lot of us here. works quickly, and it's very effective. main side effect is acne during the loading dose, but that goes away during the maintenance phase.
rinvoq! has a pretty good track record for a lot of people. like antimodez said, acne during the loading doses was the only issue i had.

messaged you from another account please send me a direct message
currently on and had questions for sure due to potential side effects and some family history but consulted with my doctor and another specialist and have been on for a few months with a biologic combo (have also had other several other drugs fail or lose effect over time). my biggest side effect has been the hair follicle inflammation (and some acne). recent bloodwork also showed an increase in my cholesterol (a known side effect) but i am still within normal parameters. definitely discuss your concerns with your doctor and ensure they'll be monitoring bloodwork, etc.
i recommend searching the sub. thereâ€™s been plenty of posts about it recently.
been on it for awhile. it works insanely quickly which is nice. pretty much as quick as steroids like prednisone. during the induction period i had some acne which seems to be a very common side effect. after going down to 30 no more acne and no other side effects.
hi, one question is wether you want to have more freedom from iv (infliximab) to an oral treatment (upadacitinib/rinvoq) directly or have an intermediate alternative as rinvoq is mainly recommended to patients that have not well been controlled on tnfa blockers (like infliximab). 8 years is a good period of efficacy on infliximab so you might want to ask for alternative treatments like entyvio, stelara or skyrizi (iv or/and subcutaneous pending on brand) as those have proven data if you feel not ready for rinvoq yet. ask your gastro about comparative side effects profiles of all 4 brands so you are able to take the right decision for what makes sense to you on top of medical advice. wish you all the best!

i have been on rinvoq since april. iâ€™m allergic to an inactive ingredient thatâ€™s in all biologics. itâ€™s worked well for me. worst part is iâ€™ve been sick with a lot of viruses. i never was sick before but iâ€™m sick now and this is the 5th time since i started. other side effects are terrible acne, but after a few months and with the help of a dermatologist my skin is completely clear now. also a lot of people gain weight. i gained weight for the first few months and had previously gained weight from being on steroids. iâ€™ve been on a weight-loss program through my insurance and have been losing 1lb a week since the end of november. and finally, the best part, it has worked really well for controlling my crohnâ€™s. iâ€™ve had a couple of small flares but otherwise feel great in that area.
make sure you have gotten the hpv vaccination.  because rinvoq will stop your body clearing it. i am dealing with severe consequences because of this.
yes â€¦.. so far so goodâ€¦. raised my cholesterol but taking red yeast rice to try to help that
hi, how severe has your acne been? i'm expecting to start the treatment but i'm anxious
were you on anything before this?
yes. to be on rinvoq you have to have at least failed one tnf-alpha inhibitor (humira or remicade). you name a medication for crohn's and i've been on it since i've had the disease since being a little kid prior to biologics coming out.
ah i wasnâ€™t aware of that. i havenâ€™t heard much of rinvoq until recently. iâ€™ve been on humira for almost a year now and itâ€™s not really helping much anymore so my doctors are trying to switch me to rinvoq since theyâ€™ve had good results with it. just a little nervous for the acne part, but i hope it all works out. how is your crohns now?
"crohn's is good. the big things i've noticed about rinvoq are:  
1) the acne was there on 45mg loading dose, but it went away when i moved to 30mg maintenance dose.  
2) seemed to take awhile to adjust to the 30mg. after going down i was having a lot more symptoms though over the next 3-4 months they just slowly became less and less frequent. these days i have a day of symptoms maybe once every two weeks and its still continuing to be less frequent."
how long were you on the loading dose for? or is it different for everybody? sorry for all the questions. when you say you were having a lot more symptoms when dropping down to 30mg, was it like before you started the medicine or it was an improvement? sorry if that doesnâ€™t make sense.
"everyone is on the loading dose for 90 days. 

it was like before i started the meds. then over time i got to the point where i'm at now where i don't have any pain or symptoms except for maybe 1 day out of every 2 weeks. that rate is also increasing so hopefully it'll be 1 day every month soon."
these sound more like flare symptoms than rinvoq side effects. the puffy eye things is a possible crohns side effect, same with everything else you've mentioned. imo, doctor time again. may need to mix things up.

could be as simple as a taper dose of prednisone
"hear hear! do not come to the internet to ask questions about your medicine because we are not doctors. 

that being said i take 30mg of rinvoq and it seems to be doing an alright job at controlling or lessening the intensity of my symptoms but mileage may vary"
[removed]
my, arenâ€™t you charming!
"i started it in march after a long string of unsuccessful medications: stelara, remicade, xeljanz, entyvio, and omvoh. plus loads of prednisone. this is my last option pretty much.

i'm not kidding that within 3 days i went from 15 bloody bms to 2 with no blood. now i'm down to 1 normal per day and feel like my old self. 

no side effects beyond acne when i started at 45mg. that went away when i dropped to 30mg and tbh it was just a few scattered zits. they were more xystic painful though, just not a lot. gave me an excuse to buy more skincare and makeup lol."
"reduced symptoms immediately after starting. iâ€™m a month in and still experiencing some symptoms, but itâ€™s all much more manageable than before. 

iâ€™ve had acne along my hairline, shoulders and upper back. it all seems to be clearing up now. besides that, iâ€™ve struck a routine where i experience relentless flatulence starting around 5am. only a few bms per day (i have a high metabolism, 3 bms would be normal for me), but the farting is a constant. suppose iâ€™m thankful i can fart fearlessly?"
"upa is so good, back to myself within weeks, i even managed 2 months steroid free! unfortunately my disease was too advance and it crept back up on me.

only side effect i noticed was high bp, which was counteracted with ramipril.

really hope it works for you ðŸ™"
"jak-ne (jak inhibitor related acne) as already mentioned.  typically cystic and painful.  muscle cramping.  those were worth it because it worked so well and so fast on my uc.  it really felt like full remission really quickly.

  
the bad news was my liver wasn't having it.  i had very elevated liver enzymes and developed fatty liver.  i was taken off it and after 8-10 weeks, went back to being pretty normal, liver wise."
i used to take rinvoq for 9 weeks and i failed. i got bad ass acne (hurts like hell) and lost a lotttt of hair! but i hope it helps you!
this has eased my mind :) i hope this is my wonder drug after all then as like you, i've failed everything else :/ glad to know the acne isn't that bad either. i did get a bit of acne due to the vedo which sounds the same as you've just described so i'm at ease now!
similar thing happened to me with vedolizumab (entyvio) 12 weeks later my liver still isn't right
can you tell me about your muscle cramps?  my son started rinvoq a few days ago and it has already helped his uc but he is complaining of muscle cramps in his leg.  reading about blood clots has me paranoid.  thanks!
"sure! so let me first put your mind at ease, it wasn't clot related. rinvoq actually has a lower incidence of clotting than xeljans, although it's still not zero. i'd really only be worried about it if you have a family history of clotting problems.

my cramping was mostly in my neck and back. it got progressively worse as i was on the drug and it felt like the worst cramping. like i was always super stressed and dehydrated. i also had deep, cystic acne on my face, head, chest and shoulders. it was deep, painful, and never really got a head on it. after a lot of tests including an ultrasound and a liver biopsy (0/10, do not recommend), it was determined those symptoms along with highly elevated liver enzymes were being caused my rinvoq. i couldn't metabolize the drug fully and the result was waste products were ending up in muscles and skin, hence the acne and cramping. i switched to zeposia and all symptoms went away in 6-8 weeks. 

all that said: don't panic. your boy probably just had a cramp from not drinking enough water. but definitely keep an eye open. make sure he gets a blood panel every six months to make sure he's doing well. if the cramping gets more consistent or you notice an uptick in acne, get on the gastro's calendar. it's not cause for alarm or time to freak out, it's just a sign that rinvoq isn't working right and it's time to look at other options. there are lots of drugs out there now for uc and you just need to find the one that's right for you."
thank you for sharing your experience!
"for me rinvoq has been amazing. just hit a month on it and saw improvement within the first week. pain went away within a couple days, bowel movements normalized within about a week, and hunger and energy came back around then as well. honestly it's hard to over state how awesome it has been for me.

the most exciting thing about it, at least for me, is it's very effective for people like me who have failed all the biologics."
been on rinvoq for 2 weeks now. i been in a really bad flare for a year. constant stomach pain a diarrhea all day, every day, for 365 daysâ€¦. rinvoq has literally changed my life. just 2 or 3 days after starting most of my symptoms are gone. in the mornings i still have some pain and diarrhea but i can finally leave my house a be a normal controbuting member of society. best of luck op!
"iâ€™ve been on rinvoq since august.
so c-diff basically destroyed my colon, took some study meds but they didnâ€™t work and then started with rinvoq.
after a few days i already noticed some improvements. doctor said it fast working and you could see results after 2 weeks.
had a sigmoidoscopy last week at 8 weeks and my colon had improved, but inflammation is still very present.

a bunch of meds didnâ€™t work for me, but this one seems to work somewhat. 
side effects iâ€™m having is some light acne (doctor mentioned this) and i had to start blood thinners because my platelets became to high due to the meds."
i was on rinvoq. i started at 45mg. it stopped my period and gave me horrible scalp acne. when they lowered the dose to 30mg, my period came back but very light.
i was in a flare for 2 years and failed to respond to 6mp, remicade and entyvio even at elevated doses. started rivoq about 2-3 months ago now i'm back down to 80 calprotectin . some symptoms remain like a bit of urgency and loose moments but overall sooo much better. im hoping these will go away in time \^
worked really well for me for about two months and now not so well, but i have an ileostomy with pyoderma and perianal crohnâ€™s so not a normal case. no issues with side effects. really hope it works for you!
"i started rinvoq on 9/11. i noticed improvements after 8 days. prior to that i was going to the bathroom 3 or 4 times a day sometimes more with fierce urgency and it was all liquid.  that went on for at least 3 months or longer. so at day 8 i was doing so much better and thankful.

i'm on 45mg, i'll be on this dose until about 12/4 and then stepping down to a lower dose. 

i previously had success with remicade and humira. 

so far so good, thankfully!"
itâ€™s working well for me so far and iâ€™ve failed humira and stelara. as long as things keep going the way they are, iâ€™m happy.

so sorry to hear about your awful flare, very happy to hear rinvoq has been working for you!! thank you so much!
thank you for sharing your experience!
thanks for sharing, i hope the side effects will subside for you
thank you for sharing and happy to hear you are feeling much better!
sorry to hear about your complicated case, thank you for sharing and for your well-wishes!

not tried 15mg. i started on 45, then moved down to and stayed on 30. this is a great idea, i'll definitely be asking to try 15 and see if i can start to feel better. i can't lie, if i had to choose between flaring up or feeling unwell all the time.....i think i'd prefer flaring up â˜ ï¸ i can deal with pain but the fatigue and fever makes me not want to do anything ever
yeah thatâ€™s not an uncommon path either, and much down to personal preference. i prefer exhausting all medications before surgery, but can definitely see the appeal of just getting it over with. read up on the surgery and talk with your gi about it. best of luck!
did your infections cause a flare?
great advice, i will be doing exactly that, thankyou;))
surprisingly no, the flare that was under control in feb has pretty much stayed in control until now even with all the infections
thatâ€™s nice! i was on my first remission since ever on rinvoq and then got covid. 3 days later i was on the verge of getting hospitalised again. now on 60mg of prednisone hoping for the best. i wanna eat shawarama though but red meat is too much to digest rn ðŸ¤£
ahaha ikwym! one of the good things about being in hospital on iv steroids is i basically eat whatever i want without consequence â˜ ï¸  so there's that!
it's been a wonder drug for a lot of us here. works quickly, and it's very effective. main side effect is acne during the loading dose, but that goes away during the maintenance phase.
rinvoq! has a pretty good track record for a lot of people. like antimodez said, acne during the loading doses was the only issue i had.

messaged you from another account please send me a direct message
currently on and had questions for sure due to potential side effects and some family history but consulted with my doctor and another specialist and have been on for a few months with a biologic combo (have also had other several other drugs fail or lose effect over time). my biggest side effect has been the hair follicle inflammation (and some acne). recent bloodwork also showed an increase in my cholesterol (a known side effect) but i am still within normal parameters. definitely discuss your concerns with your doctor and ensure they'll be monitoring bloodwork, etc.
i recommend searching the sub. thereâ€™s been plenty of posts about it recently.
been on it for awhile. it works insanely quickly which is nice. pretty much as quick as steroids like prednisone. during the induction period i had some acne which seems to be a very common side effect. after going down to 30 no more acne and no other side effects.
hi, one question is wether you want to have more freedom from iv (infliximab) to an oral treatment (upadacitinib/rinvoq) directly or have an intermediate alternative as rinvoq is mainly recommended to patients that have not well been controlled on tnfa blockers (like infliximab). 8 years is a good period of efficacy on infliximab so you might want to ask for alternative treatments like entyvio, stelara or skyrizi (iv or/and subcutaneous pending on brand) as those have proven data if you feel not ready for rinvoq yet. ask your gastro about comparative side effects profiles of all 4 brands so you are able to take the right decision for what makes sense to you on top of medical advice. wish you all the best!

i have been on rinvoq since april. iâ€™m allergic to an inactive ingredient thatâ€™s in all biologics. itâ€™s worked well for me. worst part is iâ€™ve been sick with a lot of viruses. i never was sick before but iâ€™m sick now and this is the 5th time since i started. other side effects are terrible acne, but after a few months and with the help of a dermatologist my skin is completely clear now. also a lot of people gain weight. i gained weight for the first few months and had previously gained weight from being on steroids. iâ€™ve been on a weight-loss program through my insurance and have been losing 1lb a week since the end of november. and finally, the best part, it has worked really well for controlling my crohnâ€™s. iâ€™ve had a couple of small flares but otherwise feel great in that area.
oohh i havenâ€™t heard of this one!
i think it's still off label but used fairly frequently? but not completely sure. glad it worked for you and hope you find something that works for you again soon
none of the biologics have a "high potential to get cancer." there's a slightly higher risk of fairly benign skin cancer (not melanoma), and a lower risk of colon cancer, with humira, for example. overall, mortality risk drops rather than increases.
"the good news is that everyone responds differently, and _all_ the listed medications are reasonably effective on psa. cosentyx is not _necessarily_ superior to the others, both in terms of efficacy or side effects.

in fact, many doctors prefer adalimumab (humira, amjevita, etc.), which has long been the gold standard in rheumatology thanks to the established efficacy profile (especially when combined with methotrexate), which is generally superior.

in terms of side effects, all biologics are ""safe"". this is a topic with a lot of nuance, because every drug out there has risks, including extremely rare complications.

to date, studies do not show increased cancer risk when accounting for the fact that psoriasis/psa itself increases cancer risk. there's some concerns about non-melanoma skin cancers (e.g. carcinomas, which are much less dangerous than melanoma) and lymphomas, but the risk is really, really low."
at least you only have to fail once.  my insurance is requiring me to fail 3 before they will pay for anything else.
i loved enbrel! if this is your first biologic, i wouldn't be worried. there are plenty of good ones on the list to choose from. who knows, maybe one of the drugs on the list would actually work better than cosentyx for you.
stelara costs them $21,000 a month. letâ€™s go with that one it sounds fun. iâ€™d personally love to watch my insurance company pay for that instead of a much cheaper one.
"they likely have significant discounts on those products, but not for the one selected for you. there are some good medications on the list, i've experienced some of them.

no to enbrel for me. i was always sick on this.

i was in the study for cosentyx 10 or so years ago, and it was the first time in my life i can think of where my skin was clear (or *very* nearly so) and my joints felt normal. eventually it did start to lose some efficacy, as if my body adapted to it. maybe i was just too inconsistent with my dosing schedule.

sad pass on stelara ... it worked well for my plaques and i liked the 3 month dosing schedule *in an office* so i wouldn't *screw up* my dosing schedule, but it did nothing for my arthritis. *nothing*. injections were not painful.

doc put me on talz (not on your list), which worked about as well as cosentyx for me. long dosing schedule like stelara, but the injections were painful. i preferred the syringe so i could control the pain by ajusting the flow rate.

skyrizi is working reasonably well for me right now, but it's something like 85-90%. i still get arthritic pains, and some of my plaques have reappeared in a very mild form. this medicine feels like nothing going in, so i'm good with the auto injector.

i don't know the severity of your condition, but for me the quality of life improvements are significant enough to make them worthwhile. i just wish i could go back in time and give my great uncle one of these miracle medicines. he suffered greatly and was in lots of studies in the 60s and 70s. one that i heard of was that he had gold, in some form, injected into his joints. he must have been quite desperate."
they deny me every year but my rheumatologistâ€™s office has someone that does appeals and theyâ€™ve always won them. you can also write an appeal yourself.
so i used to have united healthcare and went through this. my rhume wanted to put me on cosentyx but it was denied. i had to start out with mtx, then after it hurt my liver enzymes, united would only approve otezla, which failed misrably within 5 months two bad flare ups, my rhume still tried to get me on cosentyx but still wouldnâ€™t get approved. i had a choice between enbrel or humira. i picked enbrel. i am doing ok on it for now. if you are wonder why i chose enbrel - it seems to have more longevity for effectiveness. most humira patients i have read it fails them within 2 years, but there have been psa and rheumatoid arthritis patients on it over 10 plus years with great success. also mtx is not given in conjunction with enbrel to prevent antibodies like with humira.
well i have failed enbrel, humira, remicade (drug induced lupus) and cosentyx. i am now on stelara and so far itâ€™s working. (a little over a year)
"i had the same experience with my insurer.  each insurance carrier has their preferred formulary items based on pricing, etc.  

just to add a positive note: i was originally prescribed humira but it was denied because my insurer would only cover cimzia (along with one each of the other classes of biologics).  i felt the same way when i received my denial, but in the end, have had good success (knock on wood) with the cimzia they required me to try first."
"optum pharmacy is the drug subsidiary of united health.  before about 3 years ago they were agnostic between taltz and cosentyx (both are il-17a inhibitors with taltz about 10x more potent on a molar basis).

they changed that to prefer taltz in their formulary probably through negotiating with the manufacturers. at the time i was on cosentyx and they asked me to switch to taltz or have my doc provide the reasons why i needed to be on cosentyx.  taltz has been great for me so far.

i bet this is the reason for denial.  ask your doc if taltz would be fine for you (no reason to think it wouldn't) and i bet that prescription will go through."
step therapy needs to be illegal. hopefully your dr. will go to bat for you. i think it took mine 3 tries, and i did almost every step and have documented health reasons why i skipped a couple steps. good luck.
"copying an old response of mine: [https://www.reddit.com/r/psoriaticarthritis/comments/16rrpd8/comment/k26uxhg/](https://www.reddit.com/r/psoriaticarthritis/comments/16rrpd8/comment/k26uxhg/)

>my insurance insisted on step therapy. i had to start with cheap drugs and let them fail until they would approve the drugs my rheumatologist requested (cosentyx).

>i started with methotexate (step 1). the side effects were pretty bad, for me. there was no way i could stay on it. once i reported enough of the side effects to my rheumatologist, he appealed my health insurance's denial successfully. then i went on humira (step 2). this biologic helped my arthritis, keeping inflammation lower, but did nothing for my psoriasis. now i'm on cosentyx (step 3). it seems to be working well for my psoriasis, but isn't doing much for my arthritis. these biologics behave differently in every one. i hope your first one works for you!

not all biologics work for all people. i started one one and then switched to another. and then my rheumatologist added dmards to my schedule. cosentyx made my psoriasis vanish. sulfasalazine was very effective in reducing my arthritis. and i recently started taking leflumonide, which we hope will reduce it further. i'll probably stay on maximum doses of tylenol and ibuprofen for the rest of my life. but i can walk again, use my hands, touch the ground... all things i couldn't do before my diagnosis."
i was also denied but dr filed an appeal on united healthcare and i was able to get it.
"the safety piece that iâ€™ve heard,  is that it is a little more targeted and leaves you less likely to get infection. that being said, infections are pretty rare. just be careful to keep wounds clean and try not to catch too many viruses. they usually want you to try something in the tnf class first before they will move you on to the il 23 and 17 blockers.
good luck"
"if you have commercial insurance that denies bimzelx you can get it for up to two years for like $15 a month. hopefully 2 years would give you time to get different insurance on the state marketplace or try to get a job with better insurance. i started it as my first biologic 2 weeks ago and already my skin psoriasis is vanishing. my arthritis is gone. i am going to taper off my meloxicam to see if bimzelx can do all the heavy lifting or if i still need to supplement with meloxicam. i think it is a good deal for a couple of years. it is new to the market for psoriasis and is approved in other countries for psoriatic arthritis. you just need to find a doctor to play ball.

bimzelx doesnâ€™t appear to have a malignancy signal. it is like cosentyx. ask your rheumatologist if she can go through the process. my dermatologist did it for me but my rheumatologist said she would have if i didnâ€™t already get it.

edit: are you in boston? if so, bwh participated in the trials and dr. avery lachance is a good dermatologist if you have skin psoriasis for access to the drug. dr. merola a dermatologist/rheumatologist who helped write some of the papers moved to texas but i bet you could find a rheumatologist at bwh familiar with bimzelx."
"cosentyx covered till youâ€™re covered. 
2 years. 
lots can change including your insurance carrier and or policy. 
talk to them about that. 

but, those drugs are very personal. what works for one doesnâ€™t for another. i loved cosentyx till it stopped working. tnf did nothing. il23 cleared skin but not joints. just started rinvoq-100% clear skin (omg) and joints (spine especially) responding well. 1 month in. my rheum described it like steroids wo the side effects. she likes that if i got sick i could stop it immediately. 

i am super excited about bimelex (sp?) so i know i have something else to try. 

itâ€™s ok to try something else. but,  contact the manufacturer. you can likely get it if insurance denied it."
i tried enbrel, stelara and skyritzy. i would try skyritzy. then if it doesnâ€™t work you will have the option to try cosentyx, however, i never tried cosentyx but i have a friend who does, she has been getting cosentyx for a few years, she still having some mild skin flare ups and some very painful psa flare ups.
try novartis patient program. your dr can get you applied. no copay if you make less than 120000 or something like that.
insurance companies get kickbacks from some of the drug companies so those are the ones that they force you into. they can call them "relationships" or "rebates" or "programs" but if you call it what it is, it's a kickback.
you gotta love united health ðŸ™„. unfortunately that is my insurance and i donâ€™t have the option to change it unless my employer does in june. iâ€™ve not started on a biological yet maybe in may when i go back. so nice to know iâ€™m going to have trouble.
"each insurer has a preferred list of biologics they've negotiated better prices with.

as with most things in the us - it just comes down to money.

but as u/tivadiva2 said, these drugs are tried and tested. cosentyx sucks (imo, anyway) skyrizi has 4 doses a year - see if you can get your biologics prescriber to select that."
they denied it for me at first too. cosentyx has a program that will cover cosentyx for you until the insurance will. after about 5 months united started covering it. so you definitely still have options to get it!
ask your physician how to apply to the manufacturer. i have united healthcare and they didnâ€™t want to pay for anything. but going through the manufacturer i was able to get two different biologics at no cost.
my rheumatologist prescribed humira instead. i guess iâ€™m going to try that & see what happens. f*#k it all at this point. whatever.
do you know if the  dr is pocketing money from cosentyx maker? these are very generous options costing 70-200k a year from insurance and he should have prescribed the preferred drug
"i have united health and just got approved for cosentyx. i did enbrel and rinvoq for 3 months on each, but neither one helped. 

i hope you find relief one way or another soon."
"my doc told insurance that i can not take those because i have a history of breast cancer. this is true. she is a rheumatologist who specializes in cancer pts. 

she also said insurance fights less of the dermatologist gets behind it.  so try that. ask rheumatologist for their buddy in derm."
my rheumatologist said that the higher risk could just be because people with autoimmune diseases have a higher risk anyway.
enbrel worked wonderfully for me until i contracted meningitis. i didnâ€™t know anyone with meningitis but had to be contracted from someone. so whoever i got it from they were likely asymptomatic because they had a healthy immune system while mine was compromised enough to contract meningitis. i was in hospital 10 days and now unable to work due to residual cognitive deficits. maybe i should not have even shared this information because i would not want to discourage anyone from taking a biologic. i personally will not use enbrel again, but iâ€™m on a different biologic.  this is a known risk, and probably more likely than cancer as a side effect, but in my opinion, not reason enough to avoid a biologic.
true. i have had pretty good luck with enbrel. joints are great but maybe 95% clearance with skin which is pretty good
"years ago, my insurance required me to try stelara before i could try talz. they told me this was because they had negotiated stelara down to something like $150 per dose. since the maintenance dose was once every 3 months, that's $50/ month (plus the cost to administer, i suppose, since it required a nurses visit)

that made perfect sense to me, and would ostensibly help prevent insurance rates from rising too much for my coworkers.

the only issue for me with stelara personally was that it did not improve the arthritic component of my psoriasis the way cosentyx had (i was in the study prior to this). i was happy with how it controlled my plaque psoriasis though."
i like your style a lot.
thanks for the reply and positive info. glad to hear youâ€™re having some success, i hope it continues!
that assumption got me into trouble with my united plan - mine uses cvs/caremark instead of optum, and taltz is not preferred with a primary diagnosis of psa.  it's one of the preferred meds for psoriasis, but only if that's your primary diagnosis.  it was a preferred drug with them as recently as 2021, but i had to stop the taltz after the loading dose.  my doc's office didn't think it was worth the fight given the other choices they gave me.
thanks for this info. i live in florida but this is good info, thanks!
i think the program from cosentyx is called "covered til your covered"
"yeah, i can use cvs also but optum is literally a wholly owned subsidiary of united healthcare and they try and steer us to use their home delivery and specialty pharma.

""in 2017, optum accounted for 44 percent of unitedhealth group's profits.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/optum#history"
right, but apparently some plans (mine is geha) have chosen to use a different pharmacy benefit manager, instead of optum.  my rheum's office keeps sending everything to optum, who calls me, and the rep asks confused because i don't exist in the system.  i remind the doctor's office that the information on my insurance card is correct, and that they need to handle it via caremark.  they, like you, aren't used to seeing united as the network but another pharmacy benefit manager.

"almost the exact same path. started on humira, no change, went to infliximab. thought it was working until i tapered off the pred. did the blood level/antibody test and that was good. back on pred, doubled the infliximab dose, symptoms back after tapering pred. i was declared â€˜resistant to anti tnf therapyâ€™. 

iâ€™ve been on rinvoq for almost 3 weeks and am down to 12.5mg of pred. so far, so good but the true test is if i can complete the pred taper and make it a week without flare symptoms returning. 

no issues with rinvoq so far. a little bit of acne (nothing terrible), but i have that any time iâ€™m on pred. the best part is only one bm per day. itâ€™s been over a year since iâ€™ve been able to say that.

edit - it was about 6 weeks from my last infliximab infusion before i started rinvoq. my gi said that was enough time to clear things out."
"this sounds really hopeful! 

thanks for the response!

i also get acne and oily skin on steroids it's not fun.

fingers crossed we are both clear soon!"
lots of luck! i tried almost all the biologics and xeljanz, nothing worked. i started rinvoq two and a half weeks ago and within days i was back to normal. it's a miracle for me and i hope it is for you too.
not only did it put me in complete remission, the bottles are fun to open
rinvoqs numbers are great plus itâ€™s so much easier to take than a infusion! keep up on your skincare it caused acne for me. reach out if you have any questions.
rinvoq has been great for me - worked within days! hope and pray that it does the same for you ðŸ˜Š
hoping you have the same success iâ€™ve had with rinvoq.  it was a last ditch effort before surgery and rinvoq got me into remission after a brutal 15 month flare and was able to avoid surgery.
best of luck! i see good things about it on here.
hopefully starting today as well. failed infliximab unfortunately, so here's hoping rinvoq will work.
i heard great things! this is the one my friends!!
"good luck!  it worked great for me.  i noticed improvement within days.

only negative was acne that became fairly prevalent.  that started to go away at the end of the third month, which was the first month of being on 30mg.  no more acne after almost 4 months on the 30mg dose."
wishing you all the best! i am starting rinvoq today too after failing inflectra.
i just started too! ðŸ¤žðŸ½ðŸ¤žðŸ½ðŸ¤žðŸ½
rinvoq has been an absolute lifesaver for me! i've been on it now for 9 months and it started working within days. my only warning is that i had the side effect of acne while on the 45mg. and this acne was bad. it went away completely when i changed down to the 30mg, and i do mean completely. pretty much vanished over night. my doctor warned me about the potential side effects, of course, but i didn't realize how bad the acne could really be. my advice is to power through the acne if you get the acne side effect. it really does go away! some people don't get it at all.
rinvoq is amazing. best of luck! been on it almost two years now. put me in remission very quickly.
great drug but be aware that it can cause shingles, so first signs of back pain, followed by a rash, think shingles.
it put me in remission. best iâ€™ve felt in years. godspeed ðŸ«¡
it helped me gut wise. but gave me extremely bad muscle aches and shortness of breath. i wish you all the luck in the worldâ¤ï¸
"been on rinvoq almost 1.5 years been the best medicine iâ€™ve taken so far. no side effects to speak of. 

hopefully you will have great results!!"
working for me so far, i been on it for 5 months. slight headaches and slight acne were my only side effects during the induction phase at 45mg. went away in month 3 when i went to the 30mg dose
i'd like to add to the success stories. xeljanz worked great for about 2.5 years for me, and then symptoms came creeping back into a full flair. i was put on rinvoq samples, and unlike other stories here it took longer than 2 weeks (over 6 weeks) to see visible improvements. because of this i'm on a longer induction period before dropping to 30mg. so don't fret if you don't see results in the first two weeks!
it took a while to work for me, but i have seen improvement. i was very skeptical about it, but it seems to be a really good option. try to take it at the same time each day and take it by itself.
i started rinvoq about a week ago, and it's made a huge difference. i can go for a walk again!
"saw a commercial for this at the gym, glad to hear it's working so well for you! if the remicade doesn't help my dad, i'm gonna inquire about this one soon! 

all the best to you \~"
worked for me within a week. started to see improvement within the first 3 days.
does insurance cover it? how much is it typically?
just saw a commercial for this on tv yesterday
sending you so much love and well wishes! my boyfriend has failed several biologics as well and he is finally in remission now on rinvoq! heâ€™s been taking it since about october and said he felt better on it almost immediately!
remember to stay hydrated + electrolytes not just water 24/7
i just got my sample of rinvoq 45mg for ulcertive pancolitis. hope this works
when i first went on that medicine, my poop was formed in one day, and iâ€™m not even being dramatic. it really is a miracle pill.
[deleted]
that's amazing! it's crazy how fast the right med can take action. with entyvio and stelara i was always, well i think it's helping...and then with infliximab there was a definite, yes i know it's helping. cheers to healing!
yeah my doc said sheâ€™s had a lot of success with her patients on this itâ€™s just hard to get insurance to cover it. but she said the people it worked for felt better in a matter of days. glad it worked for you!
"seconded. 48 hours from the first dose to effectiveness (coming from a 1.5yr long flare) to only seeing trace amounts of blood.

as a bonus side effect, itâ€™s also worked magic on my rheumatoid arthritis symptoms as well. my joints feel better than they have in nearly 20 years."
itâ€™s always so great to see updates from you & im so glad that rinvoq is helping you. <3
hey krissi, iâ€™m so glad itâ€™s working for you! iâ€™ve seen your posts on this feed and know you were struggling to get back in remission for a while, happy to hear the news! ðŸ«¶ðŸ½
iâ€™d be lying if i didnâ€™t say iâ€™m excited to use this little opener thing on the lid lol
how long have you been on it? the acne disappeared for me soon after dropping to 30mg
same here! tried literally everything and was flaring for about 2 years. i didnt see results immediatley bc the flare was so long/severe, but after a few months on rinvoq i was doing much better
actually just had my first shingles vaccine dose yesterday. doc wouldnâ€™t let me start it until i got it lol
my doc said one of her patients it took 3 months before seeing improvement but most of them it was within days.
my insurance covered it but without it itâ€™s expensive. they do have an assistance plan thatâ€™s fairly easy to get on to though and you just pay $5 a month
in two doses in so far and i havenâ€™t had any formed poops but my stomach feels better already. less cramps and i made it throughout the night without having to go.
all medications can have serious side effects. what about the effects of letting your colon bleed constantly and not absorbing enough nutrients? or having inflammation all over your body for years at a time? fear mongering isnâ€™t cool. unless youâ€™re someoneâ€™s doctor, stop trying to give unsolicited medical advice.
i'm so shocked it worked so fast, especially since prednisone started getting slower and slower at helping me. figured there was no hope left lol.
"you can get on the compassionate care program with the drug company if your insurance wonâ€™t cover it.

abbviecare is the name of the program for rinvoq in canada."
thanks! i think if i hadn't tried so many other options my own insurance wouldn't have covered it. we had compassionate care here though thankfully.
it's wild isn't it!? i can't believe how fast it worked - it also really helped the lingering joint pain i was having post-prednisone lol
aw, thank you!! :d
hi, thanks so much! i see your posts too and i'm so glad rinvoq is working for you as well! :d
"iâ€™ve been on 30mg for three weeks and the acne is still present but a lot better since i started topical
antibiotics for it"
100%. anyone starting rinvoq should be getting the shingrix vaccines (2 doses/8 weeks apart)
when i first took xeljanz i saw improvements literally the same day. so when i switched to rinvoq and didn't have an immediate response i was sorely disappointed. luckily it kicked in eventually, and i'm hoping it lasts a long time.
yeah iâ€™ve tried to many before that they covered it for me in like 2 days. but they wouldnâ€™t cover the shingrix vaccine so i have to pay for that out of pocket which sucks lol
yeah, itâ€™s a real game changer. iâ€™m glad itâ€™s working for you too!! i feel like im one of those â€œtestimonialâ€ people on the medication commercials when people ask about it, but this is the most hope iâ€™ve had in years.
yeah doc said i can start after the first dose but just make sure i get the second within 2 to 6 months
lol i feel you, they didn't cover me for shingrix either when i had to do it.
one thing to remember is to keep all your receipts! folks like us with chronic illnesses have higher than average out of pocket medical expenses, and the threshold for getting medical tax rebates is about 3-4% of your annual income.
this is for canada as well? most things are covered for me, just the small exceptions like shingrix bc i'm not over 50 and medications at random (like when the insurance company decided i didn't need to try stelara yet for some reason. but we have compassionate care to cover the big medications like that as well!)
"[yes ma'am. i'm in ontario too, so you're defintiely eligible to do this](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/lines-33099-33199-eligible-medical-expenses-you-claim-on-your-tax-return.html):

>*on the line below line 33099, enter the lesser of the following amounts:*

**3% of your net income (line 23600)**

**or**

**$2,635**

anything above and beyond those thresholds become tax deductible expenses. for me, the really nice thing is i have a medical cannabis prescription, and that allows me to basically have the majority of my cannabis be a tax-deducible expense at the end of the year.

for severe uc folks, things like diapers, bidets, special dietary needs, nutritionists/dietitians, and other quality of life items can potentially be claimed.

[some may also be eligible for an **rdsp** as well](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/registered-disability-savings-plan-rdsp/eligibility-contributions.html), which is a government funded program that works like an rrsp, but the government will match your annual contributions up to 3x what you put into it (until the age of 49)"
bestie, thank you!! valuable info for me!! also, yay for a fellow ontarian!
"totes! i was upset that i hadnt heard about these programs earlier in life!!

it's really worth taking advantage of these assistive programs wherever we can, the rdsp thing blew me away that the gov't basically gives you free money for putting money into it."
no but iâ€™d try damn near anything at this point.

at least in the us there was an issue with the trial design that the fda didn't like. that's held up approval of it until early this year as the fda requested additional info. i'm assuming the eu did a similar thing since it was an issue with the trial design.
for regular approval it usually takes 1 year.
thanks! do you have a source?
my gi doc when we were talking about what to do next. never found much online about it, but figured he's more keyed into the fda gi meetings than i am.
there is also stelara to try if you haven't already
"if infliximab had no effect but it wasnâ€™t due to antibodies then i find it strange that your doc then recommended humira, as it is also a tnf drug. sure, when itâ€™s a last resort try it, but after that i would have gone with vedolizumab or ustekinumab. iâ€™d definitely try both of them before surgery. for me, infliximab and then vedolizumab failed very quickly (or rather never really worked) but ustekinumab (stelara) worked for about a year. i was on azathioprine during all of them. you may also want to look into allupurinol  as a combo.

finally there are also the -mods to try; ozanimod or etrasimod.

if your gi is pushing surgery without at least offering the other medical treatments, iâ€™d recommend you get a second opinion or a new gi (assuming youâ€™ve not left out something that would indicate surgery being necessary or a more apt solution). surgery is great for many, and iâ€™ll likely get there also, but iâ€™m going to try everything before that, and currently having great success with filgotinib."
i'd try something different too, humira isn't great.
"i got a total colectomy last week.

i tried stalera/ entyvio in combination after failing amgevita and infliximab separately. i also take steroids as well as the biologics.

bar some uncomfortable stoma farting as i type i am doing better already and eating more"
someone mentioned stelara, but omvoh should also be considered. from what i understand it is a better version of stelara.  may be hard to get it covered though.
youâ€™ve got a lot of options before surgery. iâ€™d find another one for consult or find an actual ibd specialist va a general practitioner gastroenterologist. even just in the last year there are three newly approved medications by the fda.
there is, something tells me my doctor will fight another medication course should this fail.
"yup this is the reason i rejected adali and am now going for vedolizumab.

but i honestly do not know why they chose that option to begin with.

i will certainly ask at the next appointment."
sounds like i made a logical choice then glad to see people agree.
glad to hear you're on the mend! keep me posted on how you get on, it could well be on the cards for me in the near future.
omvoh was actually my first choice but the doctor wanted this one first, who knows i may get another shot but based on current events it's a coin toss
"i have seen plenty approved indeed.

the only issue is with the uk health service, getting yourself shipped to another consultant/specialist is a time consuming process which i might not have the next time a flare gets bad enough."
personally i would exhaust every available option even if that means seeing another doctor, no harm in a second opinion. all the best to you
">sounds like i made a logical choice 

if you think this sub is logical than man do i have some ocean front property in the middle of the sahara to sell you. really you're in a place where there isn't a ton of data to back up what to do.   


arguments could be pretty easily made for either entyvio or humira, but they're more opinions than hard facts. the only thing where there is more hard data on is thiopurines haven't been shown to increase response rates of entyvio in blinded trials."
fingers crossed it works for you! i'm about to try rinvoq after stelara and humira both failed, or possibly a combination of meds. so much fun playing thia game.
drop me a dm if you have questions in the future. honestly the ostomy sub reddit is amazing. full of really supportive people
i wish you luck! i hope the combo treatment helps. it sounds like you have a pretty good handle on things. keep us updated on how you do!
a second opinion is always a good choice the hospital i was discharged from was different to my local but the consultants were hesitant to give me too much of an opinion as to not step on toes.
you definitely have a point, but humira's own data put remission at 1 year in the teens, like less than 20% of people. not great. we try everything tho coz you never know, you could be the 14% or whatever.
i had some success on rinvoq at the 45mg loading stage it just started to fail at 30mg and they wouldn't let me try another 2 months at 45 despite all the uk nhs guidelines stating it was fine to do so to see if it stabilized which i am frustrated at.
will do! thanks for the support.
yup humira doesn't look great on paper no matter who the study belongs too but as you say i could be the 14% but i will take that option later rather than sooner when there are so many more promising options at the moment.
"when you design a study you do it to test a specific question. in phase 3 trials that hypothesis is not i want to know how effective humira is. that hypothesis is i want to know if humira is better than a placebo.  


if you look into current ways we have of optimizing humira and the response rates they're going to be much much much higher. that's because of things that are learned like combo therapy as well as things that we can't do during the trial like drug level monitoring.   


if you ask any doctor out there if in the real world they expect a 20% response rate to humira even they'll tell you no they expect higher because of that."
that's rough they wouldn't let you keep going. i have no idea what they do in that case where i am (australia). i hope you have success with the next med you try.
it's nice to get a choice in the proceedings, and try what you feel is a better shot first.
i know how the trials go and adding other meds etc. it also isn't approved at higher doses in many countries (like mine: we don't even test levels in blood anyhow). other studies show if you fail one anti tnf med, you probably fail them all, hence why my doctor won't go there again for me. by all means, try humira. i still think there are better options. i am entitled to my opinion, and my lived experience.
itâ€™s very common. search â€œsteroid moon faceâ€ it never goes down for me until i stop the steroids.
iv been on steroids for over 4 months and the round face aka moon face is awful i know, not to mention the weight gain is a struggle for me ( i have always been over weight) but i have noticed that the weight in the face comes off quickly and the extra weight in my mid section takes a little longer but it does get better after stopping the steroids! best of luck, i hope you feel better!
i didnâ€™t know it was something common, thanks for your answer! i started the treatment last week so 11 more weeks to go before lowering to 30mg, hope youâ€™re doing good!
today is my best day for over a month, so thatâ€™s good!
good luck with the rinvoq trial for vitiligo! it's exciting to hear about new treatments being explored. i haven't participated myself, but documenting your experience weekly sounds like a great idea to track any changes. hopefully, you'll be on the active drug and see positive results. fingers crossed for you! ðŸŒŸ
i must say, that even though we have more drugs than the ra peeps i am interest3d to see how mny are like me in failing lots of biologics. it explains why my rheum is not as worried as i am.
noice! thanks!
thank you for sharing!
excellent info! thank you for sharing :)
this is super interesting.  thanks.
thanks op
yes, iâ€™m on oral baricitinib 5mg once daily. itâ€™s been about 6 months and i have noticed some repigmentation.
dare we ask the cost $?
i'd say it is safer to take non-oral jaks for vitiligo just because of the potential side effects
thanks for sharing, any side effects?
where are the repigmentation ? in witch parts of ur body ?
where are the repigmented areas ? do u know if it helps on hands or feet ?
"its â‚¬1,100 a month in malta - imported from usa, i managed to find olumiant from a pharmacy in india and bangladesh, they will ship with dhl and 1 month supply is around â‚¬500.

i have also found â€˜barigenâ€™ which is generic olumiant. it contains the same active ingredient - baricitinib. one month supply for barigen costs only â‚¬30 from these same pharmacies.

i havenâ€™t started yet, have an app with my dermatologist next week and will ask if i should buy the olumiant at â‚¬500 or barigen at â‚¬30"
none whatsoever.
where did you find it at?
"i just started rinvoq as stelara didnâ€™t work for me. i searched the sub for rinvoq posts before starting and it seemed the most common side effect was acne. i now am experiencing the acne. i had no side effects from stelara. 

and acne probably isnâ€™t a big deal to some people but i already have rosacea and iâ€™m just really mad about dealing with yet another thing in my 40s."
rinvoq is a jak-inhibitor, not a biologic. i don't have any experience with it. i was on stelara with minimal side effects (just some fatigue/mild headache after taking it), but it didn't work well enough, so i switched to skyrizi. it has a similar mechanism of action to stelara, but it is given at a higher dose, so my gi thought it might work for me since i had some improvement on stelara but not enough.
"i don't have any experience with either but i take adalimumab. i like to travel a lot and the injections can be a pain in the ass especially if you want to go somewhere for awhile or to multiple places. so that's something to think about if you like to travel.Â 
it can still be done but sometimes i'm annoyed i failed azathioprine ðŸ˜‚"

if it helps, my acne on rinvoq evaporated about a month after finishing the loading dose. (i am still using some otc acne product just in case, but they are keeping up now!)
oh man, i'm already a bacne sufferer - good to know that you didn't get any side effects from stelara - i'm leaning that way because as far as i can tell it seems to have a higher success rate
thanks for the correction
"i've failed adalimumab! which is a shame because i've been taking it for a year - travel isn't a huge problem for me, i love the hermit life but i do hate needles so getting rid of those pens would be good news! 

thanks for the insight!"
oh, that does give me hope.  thanks!
believe it or not, rinvoq actually has the higher success rate, its just the newer med only having been approved in like.... april of last year. totally valid to shoot for stellara though.
"oh, the info i saw said otherwise, but that's good to know! i didn't realise how new it was - i was directed to crohn's and colitis uk for details on each and there are some statistics there, although they're not all that easy to decipher - they're each measured against a placebo.

i like the idea of taking a pill instead of injections so this is good news"
yea, its relatively new, and stellara has a higher "fresh diagnosis" success rate, but rinvoq works better for people who have failed at least one biologic. its kinda weird like that.
"hi. i am in the exact same position as you. i have been on rinvoq since 2018 (i was on the original clinical trial before it got licensed).  i developed genital warts around 6 months of being on it. i was on 15mg for 3 months. then 30mg for the next 3 years or so. i am now on 15mg for the past 12 months. my dose was reduced due to persistant hpv infection and warts.

the warts have 99% gone away since i reduced ny dose from 30mg to 15mg, but there are a few tiny ones still there. i am treating with catephen cream, but they are not going. i had some removed with laser surgery, and thankfully they did not come back.

you can see in my post history what a nightmare i have been going through with persistant hpv.  it turned into ain3 and i have now had 5 painful surgeries to remove the pre-cancerous lesions from my anal canal. the ano-rectal surgeon told me (and my gastro dr) that unless i come off rinvoq, i will most likely be unable to clear the hpv infection and i will need to have surgeries forever.  

this was not a sustainable situation. so, i made the difficult decision to come off rinvoq. this is devastating as its the only drug that has put my inflammatory bowel disease into remission. after years of sufferering. i am now being moved to stelara which i really hope will keep me in remission. and allow my immune system to clear the hpv and the ain.

i did tell the doctors when i was on the trial about me getting warts, but i was told that nobody else had reported this side effect, and so it was just me and unlikely to be the rinvoq. well, now the dr's have accepted this as a side effect of the drug. and clearly, its now happened to you.

just take lots of immune enhancing supplements. i hope you can clear the hpv."
this is why i avoided taking them. i really need to take my prednisone prescription, but considering the fact that i have hpv i haven't taken it due to the fear of my warts growing out of control.
"just chiming in with my experience. i took azathioprine for 20 years for my crohn's disease. little did i know that my hpv was active but asymptomatic for quite a long time. 

ended up with vulva cancer and having to have my left labia minora removed and they were considering removing my clitorus at one point. two additional operations later they told me about hpv and immune suppresants. 

so apparently some immune suppresants are worse than others. it is well worth talking to you doctor about the hpv coming out of remission and making a decision as to whether it's worth changing immune suppresants. i'm in the process of changing mine."
any update on this ? has anyone tried switching to entyvio and saw have been able to clear hpv (warts)? iâ€™m on stelara thinking about switching to entyvio or getting off completely
sent you a pm if you dont mind thanks !
prednisone is an immune modulator rather than an immune suppresants. so it is reputed not to be as bad but you should talk to your doctor about it.
"my recent monthly blood test results is back and it shows i have low monocytes. i asked my friend whom is an experienced nurse and she says that monocytes are basically a component that is in our immune system that protects and fight off bad germs/viruses for our body . so i have low level of it = makes it why my genital warts kept growing new ones despite old ones getting frozen off. ðŸ˜

oh and just saying , i asked my dermatologist if i should stop rinvoq because could it be causing my warts to worsen, he says no there is no interaction and it shouldnâ€™t be rinvoq at all dont worry. ðŸ™„"
yeah. i was on azathioprine for around 15 years and had warts that would not clear.  my hpv surgeon told me that, in her experience, prednisone was one of the worst culprits for hpv getting out of control.
sure
hey there sis/bro! iâ€™ve sent you a private message but i guess you havenâ€™t seen it yet ðŸ˜‚ i wanted to ask.. ever since you stopped rinvoq , did the warts gradually go away itself ?
ok have you tried budesonide instead.
thanks!
"hi there, and im a bro! lol. i didnt get any pm, not sure what happened there.  

i didnt stop rinvoq yet. i am due to stop it on the 25 october.  but, when i dropped the dose from 30mg to 15mg last summer, most of the warts disappeared - and i had them for years. even the dr treating them couldnt believe it. i was using catephen cream and sometimes cryo as well. so, no they didnt go on their own. but without the dosage drop i believe i would still have them all today."
i cant take anymore steroids as they caused me so much harm, and i became dependent. never want to go down that road again.
"i guess probably there is a glitch  with the message system. anyway i wanted to ask..

while on rinvoq did you have any new warts growing despite undergoing treatment to remove the old ones ? and yeah iâ€™ve decided to stop rinvoq for now and monitor.. not sure how long it goes out from the system"
fair call. it's shit isn't it. i haven't taken any for 15 years.
yes, i had loads of new warts appearing, despite intensive treatment to remove existing ones. it was a nightmare. i still have terrible scarring from all the years of treatments.
i guess i will have to go back to topical steroid cream for my eczema i guess.. its been 4 days since i stopped rinvoq.. roughly how long after dropping from 30 to 15 did you start to see the â€œslowing or dyingâ€ of warts ?
"it was pretty quick. i would say it was around a month before i started to see the biggest ones go away. it took much longer for the much smaller ones to go. i still have around 4 small warts which just refuse to go, and i am treating them daily with catephen cream. i believe they will never go away while i am on rinvoq.  

 i am taking so many supplements too - green tea, immune enhancers, folate, and did the whole ahcc thing too. they might have helped to some degree but rinvoq is always going to win the battle in the end, sadly."
"for those of you not r/eczemabs this really is a miracle drug. it doesnâ€™t have that weird conjunctivitis side effect of dupilumab and, at least for me, made 100% of my eczema go away. plus itâ€™s a pill, no scary injections! and it works super fast, within a few days i saw improvement. 

anyway, thatâ€™s anecdotal evidence. but if you wait ~2-3 years the studies on eczema should be out."
many people here have commented that eczema trials for this drug had excellent results. now the drug will be available off label to many people.
do you think you will manage to get the drug off label?
iâ€™m still in a trial, so iâ€™m getting paid to take it lol. i also have to wait for the canadian people to review the trials and approve it :( but maybe by the time this trial is done, itâ€™ll be available. then iâ€™ll ask my dermatologist.
just keep in mind, it took me 2 cycles at 45 mg to get into remission so donâ€™t get discouraged and be patient
i hope it works for you as well as it has been for me. honest to god lifesaver medication for me.
i wish you all the luck in the world
enjoy remission
good luck! iâ€™ve been on this almost 6 months, now at 30mg and has worked really well for me.  just a few minor side effects while on the 45 mg (low level headache and slight acne)
iâ€™m 18 months right now. stay on top of your pharmacy with the copay card and your dr with prior authorization if you have those. and hopefully you dont have to use optumrx for prescriptions they suck
best of luck to you! my 15 year daughter was on 45 mg for 8 weeks back in aug. she had an immediate positive response. then dropped to 30 mg. bleeding reappeared around november. she got colonoscopy in feb. and there was one small section that didnâ€™t heal yet and was bleeding a lot. they got approval to go back to 45 mg (got approval for 16 weeks). now at week 8 on 45 again they scoped her again and her bowl looks normal!!!! yes normal. (when she started she had severe uc). they are going to continue till to 12 weeks before dropping her down to 30. feeling very hopeful. sometimes it takes a little longer but the drug seems to really be a game changer. just have to give it time. she had no side effects either. wishing you the best.
best of luck!!
good luck! i just started it too. i joined a clinical study for it.
[removed]
best of luck!
[removed]
good luck! iâ€™ve been on this for 6 months and finally feeling like a human being!
this stuff is the shit. 2 weeks and i was feeling a hit better. a couple months and i didn't have any urgency or pain. complete remission in under a year.
i have another month to wait. wish you the best, and that i follow!
good luck!!! ðŸ™Œ
ha ha. a big â€˜ol metro line of rinvoq!
"i have an intelligent buddy who wants to utilize reddit to simultaneously contest credit repot mistakes. the thinking is they have a finite amount of time (3 to 7 days) to respond. if everyone with a credit discrepancy filed simultaneously they wouldn't be able to fight all of us individually.

good luck, i've just started it myself
6 months today iâ€™ve been on this wonder drug and itâ€™s literally pulled me out of the depths of hell! i was in a 2 year flare. the worst flare ever since diagnosed at 12. 2 days before my 40th birthday, the blood stopped and weeks before that, the urgency and frequency and pain stopped. iâ€™m truly grateful for this drug. itâ€™s been a pain in the ass staying on top of my insurance and 3rd party pharmacies but iâ€™m resilient and wonâ€™t ever stop advocating for my health. my colon was 60% ruined by uc but iâ€™m hoping to be in full remission by august when i get my colonoscopy! you got this ðŸ’ªðŸ»ðŸ’ªðŸ»ðŸ’ªðŸ»
how are the side effects i start wednesday and i'm very nervous ðŸ˜“
congrats!
i am 6 months in, and i am in remission! i hope you have great success with this!
"wait wtf?

insurance companies can... deny you your medicine??

i'm assuming you are from usa. the health care truly is shit then...."
what is this? what does it do?
i remember the relief of seeing that bottle for the first timeâ€¦ i relive it every morning when i take it too. it has been the only medication that has worked for me long term. glad you finally (possibly) found one that works!
it literally took me a year on 45. so glad i was patient.
2 cycles? like 16 weeks?
yeah iâ€™m a month and a half in and starting to finally see results. itâ€™s like iâ€™ll feel great and have solid poops a couple days and then go back to feeling like shit for a few days. baby steps.
i've started my cycle month ago after flaring for 3.5 year now and i would be more than happy to get remission after 16 weeks.
i had lots of headaches when i was on 45 mg, didn't know it was a side effect (i barely read the giant poster that comes with the pills)
"seconding this! i have been on rinvoq since january and it's literally a battle to get the new prescription every single month. the thing that gets me is that no one will tell me there is an issue or hoop to jump through until the last possible minute. 

i'll order the prescription and then assume all is normal for about 24 hours. then the specialty pharmacy will call to let me know that either my insurance denied the order or, or i owe thousands of dollars, or maybe my doctor's office failed to submit some paperwork. it's usually a 30 to 45 minute phone call where i am out on hold a bunch of times or given a number to call and it's ultimately resolved, but it's never a seamless process."

i took first dose last night and i feel totally normal
"you were able to be a year on 45mg? how was it? how were the symptoms in the beginning? 
i was on 45mg for 8 weeks and now got another 8 weeks ahead, because it works a little, but some days i am still unable to perform basic tasks. calprotectin(2800) and crp (90) are still extremely high. i am getting a little hopeless here ðŸ™„"
damn.. all good now?
yes, same here, and iâ€™m glad my gi made the call, things finally got better at week 16
thatâ€™s ridiculous, i have to do that once a year usually.  have you gotten a hold of abbvie? they have been amazingly helpful and call me every 3/6 months just check in and talk. look at the copay assistance program if you havenâ€™t already. they are an amazing company. they flat out told me if i couldnâ€™t get it to call them and they would get a bottle sent out to me.
apparently itâ€™s only been approved for ulcerative colitis for a few years so theyâ€™re still collecting data about how fast it work and stuff like that. i have to fill out some forms every night before bed about how many bowel movements iâ€™ve had, the amount of blood etc.
that's great to hear
"hang in there. mine took a long time. i was on 45mg over a year, actually. my symptoms started to improve at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, etc. i started sept â€˜22, and today i am in full clinical remission (on 30mg now). 
in the beginning itâ€™s like nothing was happening. very, very gradual improvement. side effects were acne and bumps all over my body. one time i had a bruise appear on my leg the size of a cantaloupe. that went away pretty fast. i have also gained weight."
full clinical (visual and microscopic) remission. i do have some bad days, like once every 2-3 weeks or so.
thanks
yeah, 18 weeks on 45mg for me!
good to hear that you are in remission! how were you able to be one year on 45mg? i understood from my gi, that maximum is 16 weeks on 45mg and then need to move to the next drug, if there is no remission.
good, glad to hear it.
"my giâ€™s office worked with the insurance company. for reference, i am in the u.s.
iâ€™d also failed entyvio, remicade, humira, azathioprine, and asacol hd to this point.
thank you!"
the drug is released!!! although it hasn't yet gotten approval for eczema, doctors will certainly start using it off label.
"oh cool!

iâ€™m in an eczema study for this (in canada, but iâ€™m pretty sure the study is across north america), and it is absolutely excellent, so weâ€™re not far behind in getting approval. but youâ€™re definitely right, doctors will give it off label if anyone can afford it.

any information on how much it will cost?"
"60k per year.


but usually these drugs are available by asian companies for tens of dollars soon after release of the drugs. i got tofacitinib for 25 euro per month. unfortunately it didn't work for my condition ðŸ™ƒ"

"i am french but on adalimumab (started last week). i donâ€™t know about rinvoq prescriptions but i can only say that youâ€™ll get it for Â«Â freeÂ Â» if you work here (healthcare system is good).
by the way, you can make an online consultation with a doctor using the app Â«Â doctolibÂ Â». thatâ€™s the french online platform for booking medical appointments. you just have to choose Â«Â teleconsultationÂ Â» and find a gastroenterologist who is available and book the online appointment.
if you come to paris, the saint antoine hospital is the best hospital for digestive diseases.
the second one is Â«Â pitiÃ© salpÃªtriÃ¨reÂ Â».
i am being treated for crohnâ€™s disease at saint-antoine hospital."
thank you so much. i wasn't aware there were options to book online consultations. my insurance covers any medical care in france (ill be in geneva) so this is extremely helpful.

"i first started adlimumab back in september last year when i was also at the last 4 weeks of so of a pred course. my worst symptoms at the time were arthritis related (tends to be the most debilitating for me) but my bowels were also not great - the immediate relief that i had the day after my first doses was actually quite unbelievable. zero joint pain and felt less fatigue. 
the combo of the pred and biologics helped get things under control i think. sadly i then got covid and had some very stressful events happen which kicked me back into a flare in jan. 
the bowel stuff for me is now pretty under control and i put that down to the adlimumab - joints still pretty bad but iâ€™m on methotrexate now too for that. 

so, itâ€™s worked for me, but itâ€™s the also the first biologic iâ€™ve been on so donâ€™t have much comparison"
"sounds promising! i will find out pretty fast it seems haha.

thank you for sharing, glad to hear you're doing well!"
yeah hopefully you have a similar experience - i have to say the joint pain was an easy thing to have immediate comparison of like canâ€™t move to zero aches, and the bowel stuff maybe took another week or so, so if itâ€™s not immediate donâ€™t panic. itâ€™s different for everyone and usually takes around 5 months to really get the gears turning consistently.
thanks for the newsflash i look forward to it every week keep up the great work.
just want to add another question here cause im interested in that medication. what is the success rate of rinvoq? i am in the military and despairatly want a medication to work without going biologics or i'm gonna get kicked out. thanks
i had some changes for the first week or so. six months on rinvoq and everything is normal.
"can't speak to the success rate, but a couple study participants in our ibd flare study are on rinvoq. one has been on it for about a year if i recall correctly. they previously failed tons of drugs and rinvoq has worked for them, so if you similarly have failed lots of drugs, it may be a good option? the other person in the study just started rinvoq and a week in hadn't noticed a change, but it tends to take time and varies per person. they have ibd and joint pain (which is common with ibd).   
ibd is inflammatory bowel disease btw."
"i don't know what the success rate of rinvoq is, but i believe it is a biologic. (my brain is now doubting that so anyone correct me if i'm wrong!) it seems to work well for me at the moment, but i'm just one person and other peoples' experiences may differ of course.

in general though, you should talk to your rheumatology consultant about your worries, and about what medicine to go on next. they're the best person to advise you on this, and much better placed to do so than us here on reddit. good luck!"
thanks a lot for the answer
thank you. might you have any insight into arthritis (primary long term rheumatoid  with now secondary osteo) alongside ibs that seems to present more as ibs-c, but perhaps might be ibs-m? (specifically looking for insight into the ibs side, the arthritis info is just for context.)
"i used to think the same thing but rinvoq actually isn't a biologic, it's called a targeted synthetic dmard. 

biologics are synthesized from natural sources/living things (human/animal, microorganism, etc). we essentially isolate *something* from a living source that can inhibit certain molecules/receptors/cells/cytokines/etc, and make it into a drug.

while biologics and synthetic dmards inhibit something specific, conventional dmards don't have a specific target. they work to suppress your immune system in different ways (and we still don't fully understand the mechanisms). methotrexate, for example, is something called an antimetabolite, specifically it blocks purine metabolism which has downstream effects (suchs as inhibition of t cell activation) which suppress your immune system.

targeted synthetic dmards like rinvoq target something specific (janus kinase in the case of rinvoq, not actually sure if they make any for other diseases that target other molecules) but they aren't made from something living (which is why they're called synthetic lol)

i feel like it's often talked about like a biologic though and tbh i didn't know the difference until i took it last year and was reading more about it"
this isn't diagnostic info, but we did a dr. interview once with a rheumatologist who has some theories about ibd and osteoarthritis specifically. we've been too busy to do the video editing, but we'll post it on our socials (most likely instagram) as soon as we can. the clinician didn't mention ibs :/ if you'd like to reach out to the physician, you can reach out to us in the dm's and we can pass along their info. they're based in berkeley, ca. sorry i couldn't be more help, but hopefully we have more insights after our flare study!
"huh, okay, very interesting. til - thank you for eaching! 

rinvoq has seemed to get equated with biologics to me, but perhaps i'd just not asked the right questions about it at my rheumatology appointments. thanks for the clarifications!"
hi :) thank you for the info so far. i'll look you up on socials for following along on further info. meanwhile i will reach out for the doctor's info - always worth asking for more views on this stuff.
i was on 30 mg for 90 days; some relief from joint pain but not enough so my rheum switched me. no side effects whatsoever. wish i couldâ€™ve stayed on it!
"it was meh for me. i never really got a good result. i only took it for a couple of months. it gave me severe acne (and some turned to hidradenitis suporativa). i still can't get to stop breaking out. it's been over seven months since i've quit the rinvoq. i can't tackle the acne despite salicylic acid soaps, etc. i never had acne prior to using this product. and the darn wounds from some of the acne turn into psoriasis patches.

watch out for the acne. i wish you much luck with ur health & the rinvoq. i genuinely hope it helps you."
how is the safety profile in comparison to cosentyx and taltz? iâ€™d like to. at be switch to rinvoq as well. on humira o definitely got more colds, but not on cosentyx. but cosentyx only helps like 50% on my pain and still canâ€™t close hands etc
"it's working pretty well for me. i've been on it for maybe a year? i'm not good with time.

the majority of my symptoms are pain. the few psoriasis symptoms i've had seem to be controlled.

the rinvoq works better for my hands than xeljanz, but not as well for my hips. the doc added plaquenil to work on that.

hope you have good luck with it."
i'm currently in rinvoq, has been abkut 6 months i think. i can't tell if it works or if i'm in a really bad flare. no side effects though, so there's that.
it changed my life. humira did nothing for me.
facebook has a very active rinvoq users and support page. lots of information
i was on it for six months and if anything it made both my joints and skin worse. sadly the worst biologic iâ€™ve been on, but only taking a pill once a day was way nicer than injections.
"it did well for me but gave me massive stomach issues, despite taking with a stomach protector.  indefestion, diarrhoea that lasted days, cramps. for me that was worse than the actual psa.

it really cleared my flaky face though."
itâ€™s working well for me, been on it about a year. no ongoing side effects, decent pain control. was some gastrointestinal issues when starting but only lasted a few weeks and not terrible, just inconvenient. i did get slightly better control on xeljanz (another jak inhibitor) but had constant chest infections and had to stop it. rinvoq has been the good middle ground.
i hope you can find something that works well for you!
i never really get acne either so praying this doesnâ€™t affect me much but thankyou and i hope you find whatâ€™s right for you and combat your skinðŸ˜Š
oh yeah, i second the acne, itâ€™s a pain. not worth stopping in my case as the rinvoq is working but it is a downside.
i was just swapped from cosentyx and i was just so unwell all the time it didnâ€™t work for me my pain is also at the worst itâ€™s been  but hopefully the rinvoq works and maybe you will be able to speak to someone about it only doing some relief for you and be able to get some more helpðŸ˜Š
thankyou!! glad youâ€™ve been able to get some relief hopefully i can to!
what class of drug is plaquenil?
hopefully you get more relief soonðŸ¤žðŸ»
iâ€™m so pleased for you! iâ€™m hoping same for me
thankyou! iâ€™m quite nervous to post or reply on fb due to facebooks info and reddit is private ðŸ˜Š but i will see if there is any info i can read there
i am glad no injections and all just tablets so thatâ€™s a plus for me
it's hydroxychloroquine--you know, the "magic covid cure." per the american college of rheumatology, it's a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (dmard). it can decrease the pain and swelling of arthritis. (either nothing is going to work on my hips, or i'm flaring. for a long time.)
understandable; there are a ton of posts and you can get a lot of info just be reading through and searching.
"oh haha covid cute

okay that's interesting, that's good that it's helping you!"
it looks like aloysius o'hare.
the way they have the commercial actors "double up" on that visually repairing the colon lining part is extra creepy. like it's their favorite part. ðŸ‘€
what does the bottle look like it's wearing a trucker cap?
something about the way they always show these people eating makes me want to punch all of them.
and, they've gone from "rin-vuck!" to "check, check, check, check and check," so there's that.
they want to see your colon lining.
"my daughter started rinvoq 8 weeks ago. she has now dropped from 45mg to 30mg. this is the only treatment that has worked for her after failing steroids, mesalazine, mercaptopurine, infliximab. she noticed a positive change in symptoms after a week of taking riviq and a dramatic improvement within 4 weeks. sheâ€™s now able to add foods she used to avoid back into her diet such as raw fruit and veg without it causing a problem.Â 
she had been in a flare for 2 years since diagnosis. she never went into remission. her pan colitis was so severe that if she failed rinvoq, she was facing surgery at age 14.Â 
we are thankful that rinvoq worked for her, we are just praying its keeps on working long term."
rinvoq uber alles
best decision my doctor made for my change of medication. itâ€™s given me my life back.
good luck:)
nice rinvoq is great!
"all the bestâ€¦.i started rinvoq 8 weeks ago, after inflectra failed â€¦so far so good it has worked great â€¦i started on 45 mg and after 8 weeks went to 15.
oh and ps i had problems with the cap also!"
are the pills pretty easy to swallow? i had a rough time with the mesalamine monsters. might be swapping to this in the near future, as stellara has helped, but it hasnâ€™t put me in full remission.
"watch your cholesterol and start an anti acne routine 

good luck"
thank you for sharing your experience!
thanks for sharing, i hope the side effects will subside for you
thank you for sharing and happy to hear you are feeling much better!
sorry to hear about your complicated case, thank you for sharing and for your well-wishes!
happy to hear it's working for you! thanks for sharing ðŸ’œ
happy to hear, thanks for sharing!
jak inhibitors are a step in the right direction, especially the more targeted ones. the challenge is that their entire profile suppresses the immune system and, therefore, presents the possibility of the development of malignancies and other things. again, the science is marching toward better treatment options and we should be happy about that. however, if the black box warning lists cancer as a possible side effect, i'm happy to keep my vitiligo. some risk? sign me up. major risks? nah i'm good.
yeah im not sure oral jak inhibitors will ever be a real solution, happy to stick with topicals though

"i have been on rinvoq upadacitinib (45mg) for 10 months now after mtx, humira, simponi, etanercept and jyseleca (filgotinib) didn't work properly or only for short time.

from what i've heard, rituximab is more intense as it wipes out your b-cells (please correct if wrong) so you will be very prone to infections. upadacitinib is more on the same infection risk level as the other biologics.

rinvoq has been really great, only downside is weight gain and acne but being almost pain-free is a good trade-off."
"i'm going into biologic #3, and unfortunately it's more common than you'd think. but it's not as scary, either!

when the first one failed it really threw me for a loop. i had already ""failed"" mtx. when enbrel stopped working i thought i was doomed. i brought this up at my appt, and my rheumy wrote out a chart with all the possibilities. there are so many bios on the market. according to [the arthritis foundation ](https://www.arthritis.org/drug-guide/biologics/biologics), there are 5 types: ""tumor necrosis factor-Î± (tnf) inhibitors, b-cell inhibitors, interleukin inhibitors, selective co-stimulation modulators, and monoclonal antibodies"". each category has different options, too! 

plus, treatment plans are all about the combos. in my last appt, my new rheumy told me that developing an effective treatment plan is nothing but trial and error. that's very disconcerting, but imagine having ra 25 years ago when there weren't any biologics! 

don't worry too much; mental/emotional stress can make you flare-y. as difficult as things are atm, you're moving forward to find what works ðŸ€"
my mother started taking upadacitinib now. she started with mtx got bad lung infection then tried sulfasalazine with prednisolone (did not work at all), then one more treatment i forgot about. now she is taking upadacitinib for one month. she started feeling better after 1 week but she is taking prednisolone with it.
thank you all for the replies ðŸ¥° i decided to go for updacitinib for now ðŸ§šðŸ¼â€â™€ï¸
"i started it in march after a long string of unsuccessful medications: stelara, remicade, xeljanz, entyvio, and omvoh. plus loads of prednisone. this is my last option pretty much.

i'm not kidding that within 3 days i went from 15 bloody bms to 2 with no blood. now i'm down to 1 normal per day and feel like my old self. 

no side effects beyond acne when i started at 45mg. that went away when i dropped to 30mg and tbh it was just a few scattered zits. they were more xystic painful though, just not a lot. gave me an excuse to buy more skincare and makeup lol."
"reduced symptoms immediately after starting. iâ€™m a month in and still experiencing some symptoms, but itâ€™s all much more manageable than before. 

iâ€™ve had acne along my hairline, shoulders and upper back. it all seems to be clearing up now. besides that, iâ€™ve struck a routine where i experience relentless flatulence starting around 5am. only a few bms per day (i have a high metabolism, 3 bms would be normal for me), but the farting is a constant. suppose iâ€™m thankful i can fart fearlessly?"
"upa is so good, back to myself within weeks, i even managed 2 months steroid free! unfortunately my disease was too advance and it crept back up on me.

only side effect i noticed was high bp, which was counteracted with ramipril.

really hope it works for you ðŸ™"
"jak-ne (jak inhibitor related acne) as already mentioned.  typically cystic and painful.  muscle cramping.  those were worth it because it worked so well and so fast on my uc.  it really felt like full remission really quickly.

  
the bad news was my liver wasn't having it.  i had very elevated liver enzymes and developed fatty liver.  i was taken off it and after 8-10 weeks, went back to being pretty normal, liver wise."
i used to take rinvoq for 9 weeks and i failed. i got bad ass acne (hurts like hell) and lost a lotttt of hair! but i hope it helps you!
this has eased my mind :) i hope this is my wonder drug after all then as like you, i've failed everything else :/ glad to know the acne isn't that bad either. i did get a bit of acne due to the vedo which sounds the same as you've just described so i'm at ease now!
similar thing happened to me with vedolizumab (entyvio) 12 weeks later my liver still isn't right
can you tell me about your muscle cramps?  my son started rinvoq a few days ago and it has already helped his uc but he is complaining of muscle cramps in his leg.  reading about blood clots has me paranoid.  thanks!
"sure! so let me first put your mind at ease, it wasn't clot related. rinvoq actually has a lower incidence of clotting than xeljans, although it's still not zero. i'd really only be worried about it if you have a family history of clotting problems.

my cramping was mostly in my neck and back. it got progressively worse as i was on the drug and it felt like the worst cramping. like i was always super stressed and dehydrated. i also had deep, cystic acne on my face, head, chest and shoulders. it was deep, painful, and never really got a head on it. after a lot of tests including an ultrasound and a liver biopsy (0/10, do not recommend), it was determined those symptoms along with highly elevated liver enzymes were being caused my rinvoq. i couldn't metabolize the drug fully and the result was waste products were ending up in muscles and skin, hence the acne and cramping. i switched to zeposia and all symptoms went away in 6-8 weeks. 

all that said: don't panic. your boy probably just had a cramp from not drinking enough water. but definitely keep an eye open. make sure he gets a blood panel every six months to make sure he's doing well. if the cramping gets more consistent or you notice an uptick in acne, get on the gastro's calendar. it's not cause for alarm or time to freak out, it's just a sign that rinvoq isn't working right and it's time to look at other options. there are lots of drugs out there now for uc and you just need to find the one that's right for you."
thank you for sharing your experience!
"for me rinvoq has been amazing. just hit a month on it and saw improvement within the first week. pain went away within a couple days, bowel movements normalized within about a week, and hunger and energy came back around then as well. honestly it's hard to over state how awesome it has been for me.

the most exciting thing about it, at least for me, is it's very effective for people like me who have failed all the biologics."
been on rinvoq for 2 weeks now. i been in a really bad flare for a year. constant stomach pain a diarrhea all day, every day, for 365 daysâ€¦. rinvoq has literally changed my life. just 2 or 3 days after starting most of my symptoms are gone. in the mornings i still have some pain and diarrhea but i can finally leave my house a be a normal controbuting member of society. best of luck op!
"iâ€™ve been on rinvoq since august.
so c-diff basically destroyed my colon, took some study meds but they didnâ€™t work and then started with rinvoq.
after a few days i already noticed some improvements. doctor said it fast working and you could see results after 2 weeks.
had a sigmoidoscopy last week at 8 weeks and my colon had improved, but inflammation is still very present.

a bunch of meds didnâ€™t work for me, but this one seems to work somewhat. 
side effects iâ€™m having is some light acne (doctor mentioned this) and i had to start blood thinners because my platelets became to high due to the meds."
i was on rinvoq. i started at 45mg. it stopped my period and gave me horrible scalp acne. when they lowered the dose to 30mg, my period came back but very light.
i was in a flare for 2 years and failed to respond to 6mp, remicade and entyvio even at elevated doses. started rivoq about 2-3 months ago now i'm back down to 80 calprotectin . some symptoms remain like a bit of urgency and loose moments but overall sooo much better. im hoping these will go away in time \^
worked really well for me for about two months and now not so well, but i have an ileostomy with pyoderma and perianal crohnâ€™s so not a normal case. no issues with side effects. really hope it works for you!
"i started rinvoq on 9/11. i noticed improvements after 8 days. prior to that i was going to the bathroom 3 or 4 times a day sometimes more with fierce urgency and it was all liquid.  that went on for at least 3 months or longer. so at day 8 i was doing so much better and thankful.

i'm on 45mg, i'll be on this dose until about 12/4 and then stepping down to a lower dose. 

i previously had success with remicade and humira. 

so far so good, thankfully!"
itâ€™s working well for me so far and iâ€™ve failed humira and stelara. as long as things keep going the way they are, iâ€™m happy.

"iâ€™m on filgotinib (jyseleca) which, similarly to rinvoq is a selective jak inhibitor. it was also the first med in many years that finally put me in remission.
iâ€™ve not had any infections or otherwise since i started in october, so canâ€™t relate there. with that said, you may want to speak with your doctor about your illnesses and see if there is something to be done. likely little to do except stop the med though. if thatâ€™s the case youâ€™ll have to determine whether the possible return to flaring is worth the infections. to further muddy this choice is that you have likely been on most treatments already without success. iâ€™m guessing youâ€™ve been on the various types of biologics and now a jak inhibitor. how about s1p antagonists like ozanimod or estramod? 

 if no med works, and you donâ€™t want to deal with the infections then perhaps look into surgery? 

only you can determine whatâ€™s right for you. 

also just a short note, rinvoq is not a biologic. biologics are produced from living organisms, are liquid so taken by infusion or injection and the drug name with end in -mab. i mention this because it might avoid some confusion when discussing with your gi."
"what were those 4 infections? and how old are you? 

what does feeling slightly unwell mean? like feverish or tired or drowsy? have you checked you vitamin and haemoglobin levels?"
did you try 15mg first? it can be prescribed at 15mg. it might be worth asking your doctor about stepping down to 15mg. that would suppress your immune system less, making you less susceptible to infections but more susceptible to a flare.  sounds like it might be worth it in your case. the manufacturer does recommend to "use the lowest effective dose needed to maintain response".
"i am becoming more and more ok with the idea of surgery. on top of that the thought of being on immunosuppressants for the rest of my life (i'm 24) sounds grim. if it's likely i'll need to get my colon removed one day i might aswell just do it now...that's what i'm thinking anyway. 

there are still a few more biologics to try but i don't even know if i want to anymore ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ id happily try reducing the dose but i'm running out of willpower to try treatments."
"24 years old. i had c.diff, covid and 2 other colds on separate occasions (one currently)

feeling unwell, meaning feverish and fatigued. my haemo levels are fine but not checked my vit levels.."
not tried 15mg. i started on 45, then moved down to and stayed on 30. this is a great idea, i'll definitely be asking to try 15 and see if i can start to feel better. i can't lie, if i had to choose between flaring up or feeling unwell all the time.....i think i'd prefer flaring up â˜ ï¸ i can deal with pain but the fatigue and fever makes me not want to do anything ever
yeah thatâ€™s not an uncommon path either, and much down to personal preference. i prefer exhausting all medications before surgery, but can definitely see the appeal of just getting it over with. read up on the surgery and talk with your gi about it. best of luck!
did your infections cause a flare?
great advice, i will be doing exactly that, thankyou;))
surprisingly no, the flare that was under control in feb has pretty much stayed in control until now even with all the infections
thatâ€™s nice! i was on my first remission since ever on rinvoq and then got covid. 3 days later i was on the verge of getting hospitalised again. now on 60mg of prednisone hoping for the best. i wanna eat shawarama though but red meat is too much to digest rn ðŸ¤£
ahaha ikwym! one of the good things about being in hospital on iv steroids is i basically eat whatever i want without consequence â˜ ï¸  so there's that!
it's been a wonder drug for a lot of us here. works quickly, and it's very effective. main side effect is acne during the loading dose, but that goes away during the maintenance phase.
rinvoq! has a pretty good track record for a lot of people. like antimodez said, acne during the loading doses was the only issue i had.

messaged you from another account please send me a direct message
currently on and had questions for sure due to potential side effects and some family history but consulted with my doctor and another specialist and have been on for a few months with a biologic combo (have also had other several other drugs fail or lose effect over time). my biggest side effect has been the hair follicle inflammation (and some acne). recent bloodwork also showed an increase in my cholesterol (a known side effect) but i am still within normal parameters. definitely discuss your concerns with your doctor and ensure they'll be monitoring bloodwork, etc.
i recommend searching the sub. thereâ€™s been plenty of posts about it recently.
been on it for awhile. it works insanely quickly which is nice. pretty much as quick as steroids like prednisone. during the induction period i had some acne which seems to be a very common side effect. after going down to 30 no more acne and no other side effects.
hi, one question is wether you want to have more freedom from iv (infliximab) to an oral treatment (upadacitinib/rinvoq) directly or have an intermediate alternative as rinvoq is mainly recommended to patients that have not well been controlled on tnfa blockers (like infliximab). 8 years is a good period of efficacy on infliximab so you might want to ask for alternative treatments like entyvio, stelara or skyrizi (iv or/and subcutaneous pending on brand) as those have proven data if you feel not ready for rinvoq yet. ask your gastro about comparative side effects profiles of all 4 brands so you are able to take the right decision for what makes sense to you on top of medical advice. wish you all the best!

i have been on rinvoq since april. iâ€™m allergic to an inactive ingredient thatâ€™s in all biologics. itâ€™s worked well for me. worst part is iâ€™ve been sick with a lot of viruses. i never was sick before but iâ€™m sick now and this is the 5th time since i started. other side effects are terrible acne, but after a few months and with the help of a dermatologist my skin is completely clear now. also a lot of people gain weight. i gained weight for the first few months and had previously gained weight from being on steroids. iâ€™ve been on a weight-loss program through my insurance and have been losing 1lb a week since the end of november. and finally, the best part, it has worked really well for controlling my crohnâ€™s. iâ€™ve had a couple of small flares but otherwise feel great in that area.
make sure you have gotten the hpv vaccination.  because rinvoq will stop your body clearing it. i am dealing with severe consequences because of this.
yes â€¦.. so far so goodâ€¦. raised my cholesterol but taking red yeast rice to try to help that
hi, how severe has your acne been? i'm expecting to start the treatment but i'm anxious
were you on anything before this?
yes. to be on rinvoq you have to have at least failed one tnf-alpha inhibitor (humira or remicade). you name a medication for crohn's and i've been on it since i've had the disease since being a little kid prior to biologics coming out.
ah i wasnâ€™t aware of that. i havenâ€™t heard much of rinvoq until recently. iâ€™ve been on humira for almost a year now and itâ€™s not really helping much anymore so my doctors are trying to switch me to rinvoq since theyâ€™ve had good results with it. just a little nervous for the acne part, but i hope it all works out. how is your crohns now?
"crohn's is good. the big things i've noticed about rinvoq are:  
1) the acne was there on 45mg loading dose, but it went away when i moved to 30mg maintenance dose.  
2) seemed to take awhile to adjust to the 30mg. after going down i was having a lot more symptoms though over the next 3-4 months they just slowly became less and less frequent. these days i have a day of symptoms maybe once every two weeks and its still continuing to be less frequent."
how long were you on the loading dose for? or is it different for everybody? sorry for all the questions. when you say you were having a lot more symptoms when dropping down to 30mg, was it like before you started the medicine or it was an improvement? sorry if that doesnâ€™t make sense.
"everyone is on the loading dose for 90 days. 

it was like before i started the meds. then over time i got to the point where i'm at now where i don't have any pain or symptoms except for maybe 1 day out of every 2 weeks. that rate is also increasing so hopefully it'll be 1 day every month soon."
these sound more like flare symptoms than rinvoq side effects. the puffy eye things is a possible crohns side effect, same with everything else you've mentioned. imo, doctor time again. may need to mix things up.

could be as simple as a taper dose of prednisone
"hear hear! do not come to the internet to ask questions about your medicine because we are not doctors. 

that being said i take 30mg of rinvoq and it seems to be doing an alright job at controlling or lessening the intensity of my symptoms but mileage may vary"
[removed]
my, arenâ€™t you charming!
"i just got bumped from 30mg to 45mg.
no improvements after 15 days. going to the hospital this evening and see what they have up their sleeves. never heard of 60mg of rinvoq."
i haven't heard of this. since it looks like remicade isn't working for me my doctor is really pushing me to do a research study combining rinvoq and entyvio. i am a mayo clinic 3 score. very severe. are you severe?
yeah iâ€™m mayo clinic 3 as well. i tried remicade wasnâ€™t working then they gave me a double dose of it every 4 weeks instead of normal dose every 8 weeks and it didnâ€™t work.
iâ€™m not sure you can combine biologics with rinvoq
my new gi specializes in ibd and they always have trials going on. it's a new trial. guess we'll find out lol. i was feeling good for almost 2 months and now i'm quickly getting worse. i'm willing to try almost anything. almost.
hahaha i feel you thatâ€™s me right now. doctors are saying i have to get better asap otherwise surgery time. hell no iâ€™m not doing surgery.
i got told the same thing on thursday morning by my gi. but my inflammation markers went down yesterday, thankfully, so i may be improving.
likewise my inflammation markers have dropped from 39 to 20. hopefully they keep coming down

started on rinvoq late last year, and it has been a game changer. all pain and inflammation has gone, it's like i don't have as anymore. (31m).
yes, and i did not do well.  i started with injections of humira every two weeks, but it stopped working, so i was switched to rinvoq.  i tried, but after two months, it just was not doing anything at all, and my peripheral symptoms and fatigue were just off the charts.  it wasn't good, and i felt like trash.  i am on weekly injections of enbrel now, rarely need nsaids for pain, and my fatigue is 80% improved.  tnf inhibitors seem to work well for me.  jak inhibitors, not so much :(
i was on rinvoq after being unable to tolerate humira or enbrel. in my experience it didnâ€™t help, even paired with hydroxychloroquine. taltz, an il-17 inhibitor has worked much better for me until winter hit, now itâ€™s been rough again.
"wow! that's good to hear - obviously hoping this is my case too, but i'm trying not to be too optimistic ðŸ˜‚
glad you're feeling much better!"
"thank you for your reply.
that's good to know: i will ask the rheumatologist about tnf inhibitors if these do not work.

i'm glad you found something that worked ðŸ™‚ i'm on rinvoq for at least two months, and it's only day 3, so a while before i will be reviewed again. i've had no side effects so far though so that's always good haha."
"thank you! i'll keep a note of that too if rinvoq doesn't seem to help.

i've actually seen a small improvement. i'm on crutches at the moment and if i stood for a few minutes, even with my crutches, my legs would spasm and i would be unable to move.

i'm still on crutches but i'm able to stand for a little bit longer, and when i sit in a chair for an hour i no longer get locked into position.

hopefully it continues to work, but i think a few people see improvements and then it stops working.

i'm sorry to hear you had a bad winter, i do hope you see an improvement soon."
100%. anyone starting rinvoq should be getting the shingrix vaccines (2 doses/8 weeks apart)
when i first took xeljanz i saw improvements literally the same day. so when i switched to rinvoq and didn't have an immediate response i was sorely disappointed. luckily it kicked in eventually, and i'm hoping it lasts a long time.
yeah iâ€™ve tried to many before that they covered it for me in like 2 days. but they wouldnâ€™t cover the shingrix vaccine so i have to pay for that out of pocket which sucks lol
yeah, itâ€™s a real game changer. iâ€™m glad itâ€™s working for you too!! i feel like im one of those â€œtestimonialâ€ people on the medication commercials when people ask about it, but this is the most hope iâ€™ve had in years.
yeah doc said i can start after the first dose but just make sure i get the second within 2 to 6 months
lol i feel you, they didn't cover me for shingrix either when i had to do it.
one thing to remember is to keep all your receipts! folks like us with chronic illnesses have higher than average out of pocket medical expenses, and the threshold for getting medical tax rebates is about 3-4% of your annual income.
this is for canada as well? most things are covered for me, just the small exceptions like shingrix bc i'm not over 50 and medications at random (like when the insurance company decided i didn't need to try stelara yet for some reason. but we have compassionate care to cover the big medications like that as well!)
"[yes ma'am. i'm in ontario too, so you're defintiely eligible to do this](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/lines-33099-33199-eligible-medical-expenses-you-claim-on-your-tax-return.html):

>*on the line below line 33099, enter the lesser of the following amounts:*

**3% of your net income (line 23600)**

**or**

**$2,635**

anything above and beyond those thresholds become tax deductible expenses. for me, the really nice thing is i have a medical cannabis prescription, and that allows me to basically have the majority of my cannabis be a tax-deducible expense at the end of the year.

for severe uc folks, things like diapers, bidets, special dietary needs, nutritionists/dietitians, and other quality of life items can potentially be claimed.

[some may also be eligible for an **rdsp** as well](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/registered-disability-savings-plan-rdsp/eligibility-contributions.html), which is a government funded program that works like an rrsp, but the government will match your annual contributions up to 3x what you put into it (until the age of 49)"
bestie, thank you!! valuable info for me!! also, yay for a fellow ontarian!
"totes! i was upset that i hadnt heard about these programs earlier in life!!

it's really worth taking advantage of these assistive programs wherever we can, the rdsp thing blew me away that the gov't basically gives you free money for putting money into it."
no but iâ€™d try damn near anything at this point.

at least in the us there was an issue with the trial design that the fda didn't like. that's held up approval of it until early this year as the fda requested additional info. i'm assuming the eu did a similar thing since it was an issue with the trial design.
for regular approval it usually takes 1 year.
thanks! do you have a source?
my gi doc when we were talking about what to do next. never found much online about it, but figured he's more keyed into the fda gi meetings than i am.
there is also stelara to try if you haven't already
"if infliximab had no effect but it wasnâ€™t due to antibodies then i find it strange that your doc then recommended humira, as it is also a tnf drug. sure, when itâ€™s a last resort try it, but after that i would have gone with vedolizumab or ustekinumab. iâ€™d definitely try both of them before surgery. for me, infliximab and then vedolizumab failed very quickly (or rather never really worked) but ustekinumab (stelara) worked for about a year. i was on azathioprine during all of them. you may also want to look into allupurinol  as a combo.

finally there are also the -mods to try; ozanimod or etrasimod.

if your gi is pushing surgery without at least offering the other medical treatments, iâ€™d recommend you get a second opinion or a new gi (assuming youâ€™ve not left out something that would indicate surgery being necessary or a more apt solution). surgery is great for many, and iâ€™ll likely get there also, but iâ€™m going to try everything before that, and currently having great success with filgotinib."
i'd try something different too, humira isn't great.
"i got a total colectomy last week.

i tried stalera/ entyvio in combination after failing amgevita and infliximab separately. i also take steroids as well as the biologics.

bar some uncomfortable stoma farting as i type i am doing better already and eating more"
someone mentioned stelara, but omvoh should also be considered. from what i understand it is a better version of stelara.  may be hard to get it covered though.
youâ€™ve got a lot of options before surgery. iâ€™d find another one for consult or find an actual ibd specialist va a general practitioner gastroenterologist. even just in the last year there are three newly approved medications by the fda.
there is, something tells me my doctor will fight another medication course should this fail.
"yup this is the reason i rejected adali and am now going for vedolizumab.

but i honestly do not know why they chose that option to begin with.

i will certainly ask at the next appointment."
sounds like i made a logical choice then glad to see people agree.
glad to hear you're on the mend! keep me posted on how you get on, it could well be on the cards for me in the near future.
omvoh was actually my first choice but the doctor wanted this one first, who knows i may get another shot but based on current events it's a coin toss
"i have seen plenty approved indeed.

the only issue is with the uk health service, getting yourself shipped to another consultant/specialist is a time consuming process which i might not have the next time a flare gets bad enough."
personally i would exhaust every available option even if that means seeing another doctor, no harm in a second opinion. all the best to you
">sounds like i made a logical choice 

if you think this sub is logical than man do i have some ocean front property in the middle of the sahara to sell you. really you're in a place where there isn't a ton of data to back up what to do.   


arguments could be pretty easily made for either entyvio or humira, but they're more opinions than hard facts. the only thing where there is more hard data on is thiopurines haven't been shown to increase response rates of entyvio in blinded trials."
fingers crossed it works for you! i'm about to try rinvoq after stelara and humira both failed, or possibly a combination of meds. so much fun playing thia game.
drop me a dm if you have questions in the future. honestly the ostomy sub reddit is amazing. full of really supportive people
i wish you luck! i hope the combo treatment helps. it sounds like you have a pretty good handle on things. keep us updated on how you do!
a second opinion is always a good choice the hospital i was discharged from was different to my local but the consultants were hesitant to give me too much of an opinion as to not step on toes.
you definitely have a point, but humira's own data put remission at 1 year in the teens, like less than 20% of people. not great. we try everything tho coz you never know, you could be the 14% or whatever.
i had some success on rinvoq at the 45mg loading stage it just started to fail at 30mg and they wouldn't let me try another 2 months at 45 despite all the uk nhs guidelines stating it was fine to do so to see if it stabilized which i am frustrated at.
will do! thanks for the support.
yup humira doesn't look great on paper no matter who the study belongs too but as you say i could be the 14% but i will take that option later rather than sooner when there are so many more promising options at the moment.
"when you design a study you do it to test a specific question. in phase 3 trials that hypothesis is not i want to know how effective humira is. that hypothesis is i want to know if humira is better than a placebo.  


if you look into current ways we have of optimizing humira and the response rates they're going to be much much much higher. that's because of things that are learned like combo therapy as well as things that we can't do during the trial like drug level monitoring.   


if you ask any doctor out there if in the real world they expect a 20% response rate to humira even they'll tell you no they expect higher because of that."
that's rough they wouldn't let you keep going. i have no idea what they do in that case where i am (australia). i hope you have success with the next med you try.
it's nice to get a choice in the proceedings, and try what you feel is a better shot first.
i know how the trials go and adding other meds etc. it also isn't approved at higher doses in many countries (like mine: we don't even test levels in blood anyhow). other studies show if you fail one anti tnf med, you probably fail them all, hence why my doctor won't go there again for me. by all means, try humira. i still think there are better options. i am entitled to my opinion, and my lived experience.
itâ€™s very common. search â€œsteroid moon faceâ€ it never goes down for me until i stop the steroids.
iv been on steroids for over 4 months and the round face aka moon face is awful i know, not to mention the weight gain is a struggle for me ( i have always been over weight) but i have noticed that the weight in the face comes off quickly and the extra weight in my mid section takes a little longer but it does get better after stopping the steroids! best of luck, i hope you feel better!
i didnâ€™t know it was something common, thanks for your answer! i started the treatment last week so 11 more weeks to go before lowering to 30mg, hope youâ€™re doing good!
today is my best day for over a month, so thatâ€™s good!
i must say, that even though we have more drugs than the ra peeps i am interest3d to see how mny are like me in failing lots of biologics. it explains why my rheum is not as worried as i am.
noice! thanks!
thank you for sharing!
excellent info! thank you for sharing :)
this is super interesting.  thanks.
thanks op
yes, iâ€™m on oral baricitinib 5mg once daily. itâ€™s been about 6 months and i have noticed some repigmentation.
dare we ask the cost $?
i'd say it is safer to take non-oral jaks for vitiligo just because of the potential side effects
thanks for sharing, any side effects?
where are the repigmentation ? in witch parts of ur body ?
where are the repigmented areas ? do u know if it helps on hands or feet ?
"its â‚¬1,100 a month in malta - imported from usa, i managed to find olumiant from a pharmacy in india and bangladesh, they will ship with dhl and 1 month supply is around â‚¬500.

i have also found â€˜barigenâ€™ which is generic olumiant. it contains the same active ingredient - baricitinib. one month supply for barigen costs only â‚¬30 from these same pharmacies.

i havenâ€™t started yet, have an app with my dermatologist next week and will ask if i should buy the olumiant at â‚¬500 or barigen at â‚¬30"
none whatsoever.
where did you find it at?
good luck with the rinvoq trial for vitiligo! it's exciting to hear about new treatments being explored. i haven't participated myself, but documenting your experience weekly sounds like a great idea to track any changes. hopefully, you'll be on the active drug and see positive results. fingers crossed for you! ðŸŒŸ
"hi. i am in the exact same position as you. i have been on rinvoq since 2018 (i was on the original clinical trial before it got licensed).  i developed genital warts around 6 months of being on it. i was on 15mg for 3 months. then 30mg for the next 3 years or so. i am now on 15mg for the past 12 months. my dose was reduced due to persistant hpv infection and warts.

the warts have 99% gone away since i reduced ny dose from 30mg to 15mg, but there are a few tiny ones still there. i am treating with catephen cream, but they are not going. i had some removed with laser surgery, and thankfully they did not come back.

you can see in my post history what a nightmare i have been going through with persistant hpv.  it turned into ain3 and i have now had 5 painful surgeries to remove the pre-cancerous lesions from my anal canal. the ano-rectal surgeon told me (and my gastro dr) that unless i come off rinvoq, i will most likely be unable to clear the hpv infection and i will need to have surgeries forever.  

this was not a sustainable situation. so, i made the difficult decision to come off rinvoq. this is devastating as its the only drug that has put my inflammatory bowel disease into remission. after years of sufferering. i am now being moved to stelara which i really hope will keep me in remission. and allow my immune system to clear the hpv and the ain.

i did tell the doctors when i was on the trial about me getting warts, but i was told that nobody else had reported this side effect, and so it was just me and unlikely to be the rinvoq. well, now the dr's have accepted this as a side effect of the drug. and clearly, its now happened to you.

just take lots of immune enhancing supplements. i hope you can clear the hpv."
this is why i avoided taking them. i really need to take my prednisone prescription, but considering the fact that i have hpv i haven't taken it due to the fear of my warts growing out of control.
"just chiming in with my experience. i took azathioprine for 20 years for my crohn's disease. little did i know that my hpv was active but asymptomatic for quite a long time. 

ended up with vulva cancer and having to have my left labia minora removed and they were considering removing my clitorus at one point. two additional operations later they told me about hpv and immune suppresants. 

so apparently some immune suppresants are worse than others. it is well worth talking to you doctor about the hpv coming out of remission and making a decision as to whether it's worth changing immune suppresants. i'm in the process of changing mine."
any update on this ? has anyone tried switching to entyvio and saw have been able to clear hpv (warts)? iâ€™m on stelara thinking about switching to entyvio or getting off completely
sent you a pm if you dont mind thanks !
prednisone is an immune modulator rather than an immune suppresants. so it is reputed not to be as bad but you should talk to your doctor about it.
"my recent monthly blood test results is back and it shows i have low monocytes. i asked my friend whom is an experienced nurse and she says that monocytes are basically a component that is in our immune system that protects and fight off bad germs/viruses for our body . so i have low level of it = makes it why my genital warts kept growing new ones despite old ones getting frozen off. ðŸ˜

oh and just saying , i asked my dermatologist if i should stop rinvoq because could it be causing my warts to worsen, he says no there is no interaction and it shouldnâ€™t be rinvoq at all dont worry. ðŸ™„"
yeah. i was on azathioprine for around 15 years and had warts that would not clear.  my hpv surgeon told me that, in her experience, prednisone was one of the worst culprits for hpv getting out of control.
sure
hey there sis/bro! iâ€™ve sent you a private message but i guess you havenâ€™t seen it yet ðŸ˜‚ i wanted to ask.. ever since you stopped rinvoq , did the warts gradually go away itself ?
ok have you tried budesonide instead.
thanks!
"hi there, and im a bro! lol. i didnt get any pm, not sure what happened there.  

i didnt stop rinvoq yet. i am due to stop it on the 25 october.  but, when i dropped the dose from 30mg to 15mg last summer, most of the warts disappeared - and i had them for years. even the dr treating them couldnt believe it. i was using catephen cream and sometimes cryo as well. so, no they didnt go on their own. but without the dosage drop i believe i would still have them all today."
i cant take anymore steroids as they caused me so much harm, and i became dependent. never want to go down that road again.
"i guess probably there is a glitch  with the message system. anyway i wanted to ask..

while on rinvoq did you have any new warts growing despite undergoing treatment to remove the old ones ? and yeah iâ€™ve decided to stop rinvoq for now and monitor.. not sure how long it goes out from the system"
fair call. it's shit isn't it. i haven't taken any for 15 years.
yes, i had loads of new warts appearing, despite intensive treatment to remove existing ones. it was a nightmare. i still have terrible scarring from all the years of treatments.
i guess i will have to go back to topical steroid cream for my eczema i guess.. its been 4 days since i stopped rinvoq.. roughly how long after dropping from 30 to 15 did you start to see the â€œslowing or dyingâ€ of warts ?
"it was pretty quick. i would say it was around a month before i started to see the biggest ones go away. it took much longer for the much smaller ones to go. i still have around 4 small warts which just refuse to go, and i am treating them daily with catephen cream. i believe they will never go away while i am on rinvoq.  

 i am taking so many supplements too - green tea, immune enhancers, folate, and did the whole ahcc thing too. they might have helped to some degree but rinvoq is always going to win the battle in the end, sadly."
"i just started rinvoq as stelara didnâ€™t work for me. i searched the sub for rinvoq posts before starting and it seemed the most common side effect was acne. i now am experiencing the acne. i had no side effects from stelara. 

and acne probably isnâ€™t a big deal to some people but i already have rosacea and iâ€™m just really mad about dealing with yet another thing in my 40s."
rinvoq is a jak-inhibitor, not a biologic. i don't have any experience with it. i was on stelara with minimal side effects (just some fatigue/mild headache after taking it), but it didn't work well enough, so i switched to skyrizi. it has a similar mechanism of action to stelara, but it is given at a higher dose, so my gi thought it might work for me since i had some improvement on stelara but not enough.
"i don't have any experience with either but i take adalimumab. i like to travel a lot and the injections can be a pain in the ass especially if you want to go somewhere for awhile or to multiple places. so that's something to think about if you like to travel.Â 
it can still be done but sometimes i'm annoyed i failed azathioprine ðŸ˜‚"

if it helps, my acne on rinvoq evaporated about a month after finishing the loading dose. (i am still using some otc acne product just in case, but they are keeping up now!)
oh man, i'm already a bacne sufferer - good to know that you didn't get any side effects from stelara - i'm leaning that way because as far as i can tell it seems to have a higher success rate
thanks for the correction
"i've failed adalimumab! which is a shame because i've been taking it for a year - travel isn't a huge problem for me, i love the hermit life but i do hate needles so getting rid of those pens would be good news! 

thanks for the insight!"
oh, that does give me hope.  thanks!
believe it or not, rinvoq actually has the higher success rate, its just the newer med only having been approved in like.... april of last year. totally valid to shoot for stellara though.
"oh, the info i saw said otherwise, but that's good to know! i didn't realise how new it was - i was directed to crohn's and colitis uk for details on each and there are some statistics there, although they're not all that easy to decipher - they're each measured against a placebo.

i like the idea of taking a pill instead of injections so this is good news"
yea, its relatively new, and stellara has a higher "fresh diagnosis" success rate, but rinvoq works better for people who have failed at least one biologic. its kinda weird like that.
"for those of you not r/eczemabs this really is a miracle drug. it doesnâ€™t have that weird conjunctivitis side effect of dupilumab and, at least for me, made 100% of my eczema go away. plus itâ€™s a pill, no scary injections! and it works super fast, within a few days i saw improvement. 

anyway, thatâ€™s anecdotal evidence. but if you wait ~2-3 years the studies on eczema should be out."
many people here have commented that eczema trials for this drug had excellent results. now the drug will be available off label to many people.
do you think you will manage to get the drug off label?
iâ€™m still in a trial, so iâ€™m getting paid to take it lol. i also have to wait for the canadian people to review the trials and approve it :( but maybe by the time this trial is done, itâ€™ll be available. then iâ€™ll ask my dermatologist.
just keep in mind, it took me 2 cycles at 45 mg to get into remission so donâ€™t get discouraged and be patient
i hope it works for you as well as it has been for me. honest to god lifesaver medication for me.
i wish you all the luck in the world
enjoy remission
good luck! iâ€™ve been on this almost 6 months, now at 30mg and has worked really well for me.  just a few minor side effects while on the 45 mg (low level headache and slight acne)
iâ€™m 18 months right now. stay on top of your pharmacy with the copay card and your dr with prior authorization if you have those. and hopefully you dont have to use optumrx for prescriptions they suck
best of luck to you! my 15 year daughter was on 45 mg for 8 weeks back in aug. she had an immediate positive response. then dropped to 30 mg. bleeding reappeared around november. she got colonoscopy in feb. and there was one small section that didnâ€™t heal yet and was bleeding a lot. they got approval to go back to 45 mg (got approval for 16 weeks). now at week 8 on 45 again they scoped her again and her bowl looks normal!!!! yes normal. (when she started she had severe uc). they are going to continue till to 12 weeks before dropping her down to 30. feeling very hopeful. sometimes it takes a little longer but the drug seems to really be a game changer. just have to give it time. she had no side effects either. wishing you the best.
best of luck!!
good luck! i just started it too. i joined a clinical study for it.
[removed]
best of luck!
[removed]
good luck! iâ€™ve been on this for 6 months and finally feeling like a human being!
this stuff is the shit. 2 weeks and i was feeling a hit better. a couple months and i didn't have any urgency or pain. complete remission in under a year.
i have another month to wait. wish you the best, and that i follow!
good luck!!! ðŸ™Œ
ha ha. a big â€˜ol metro line of rinvoq!
"i have an intelligent buddy who wants to utilize reddit to simultaneously contest credit repot mistakes. the thinking is they have a finite amount of time (3 to 7 days) to respond. if everyone with a credit discrepancy filed simultaneously they wouldn't be able to fight all of us individually.


however american insurance companies apparently have us without recourse."
good luck, i've just started it myself
6 months today iâ€™ve been on this wonder drug and itâ€™s literally pulled me out of the depths of hell! i was in a 2 year flare. the worst flare ever since diagnosed at 12. 2 days before my 40th birthday, the blood stopped and weeks before that, the urgency and frequency and pain stopped. iâ€™m truly grateful for this drug. itâ€™s been a pain in the ass staying on top of my insurance and 3rd party pharmacies but iâ€™m resilient and wonâ€™t ever stop advocating for my health. my colon was 60% ruined by uc but iâ€™m hoping to be in full remission by august when i get my colonoscopy! you got this ðŸ’ªðŸ»ðŸ’ªðŸ»ðŸ’ªðŸ»
how are the side effects i start wednesday and i'm very nervous ðŸ˜“
congrats!
i am 6 months in, and i am in remission! i hope you have great success with this!
"wait wtf?

insurance companies can... deny you your medicine??

i'm assuming you are from usa. the health care truly is shit then...."
what is this? what does it do?
i remember the relief of seeing that bottle for the first timeâ€¦ i relive it every morning when i take it too. it has been the only medication that has worked for me long term. glad you finally (possibly) found one that works!
it literally took me a year on 45. so glad i was patient.
2 cycles? like 16 weeks?
yeah iâ€™m a month and a half in and starting to finally see results. itâ€™s like iâ€™ll feel great and have solid poops a couple days and then go back to feeling like shit for a few days. baby steps.
i've started my cycle month ago after flaring for 3.5 year now and i would be more than happy to get remission after 16 weeks.
i had lots of headaches when i was on 45 mg, didn't know it was a side effect (i barely read the giant poster that comes with the pills)
"seconding this! i have been on rinvoq since january and it's literally a battle to get the new prescription every single month. the thing that gets me is that no one will tell me there is an issue or hoop to jump through until the last possible minute. 

i'll order the prescription and then assume all is normal for about 24 hours. then the specialty pharmacy will call to let me know that either my insurance denied the order or, or i owe thousands of dollars, or maybe my doctor's office failed to submit some paperwork. it's usually a 30 to 45 minute phone call where i am out on hold a bunch of times or given a number to call and it's ultimately resolved, but it's never a seamless process."

i took first dose last night and i feel totally normal
"you were able to be a year on 45mg? how was it? how were the symptoms in the beginning? 
i was on 45mg for 8 weeks and now got another 8 weeks ahead, because it works a little, but some days i am still unable to perform basic tasks. calprotectin(2800) and crp (90) are still extremely high. i am getting a little hopeless here ðŸ™„"
damn.. all good now?
yes, same here, and iâ€™m glad my gi made the call, things finally got better at week 16
thatâ€™s ridiculous, i have to do that once a year usually.  have you gotten a hold of abbvie? they have been amazingly helpful and call me every 3/6 months just check in and talk. look at the copay assistance program if you havenâ€™t already. they are an amazing company. they flat out told me if i couldnâ€™t get it to call them and they would get a bottle sent out to me.
apparently itâ€™s only been approved for ulcerative colitis for a few years so theyâ€™re still collecting data about how fast it work and stuff like that. i have to fill out some forms every night before bed about how many bowel movements iâ€™ve had, the amount of blood etc.
that's great to hear
"hang in there. mine took a long time. i was on 45mg over a year, actually. my symptoms started to improve at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, etc. i started sept â€˜22, and today i am in full clinical remission (on 30mg now). 
in the beginning itâ€™s like nothing was happening. very, very gradual improvement. side effects were acne and bumps all over my body. one time i had a bruise appear on my leg the size of a cantaloupe. that went away pretty fast. i have also gained weight."
full clinical (visual and microscopic) remission. i do have some bad days, like once every 2-3 weeks or so.
thanks
yeah, 18 weeks on 45mg for me!
good to hear that you are in remission! how were you able to be one year on 45mg? i understood from my gi, that maximum is 16 weeks on 45mg and then need to move to the next drug, if there is no remission.
good, glad to hear it.
"my giâ€™s office worked with the insurance company. for reference, i am in the u.s.
iâ€™d also failed entyvio, remicade, humira, azathioprine, and asacol hd to this point.
thank you!"
the drug is released!!! although it hasn't yet gotten approval for eczema, doctors will certainly start using it off label.
"oh cool!

iâ€™m in an eczema study for this (in canada, but iâ€™m pretty sure the study is across north america), and it is absolutely excellent, so weâ€™re not far behind in getting approval. but youâ€™re definitely right, doctors will give it off label if anyone can afford it.

any information on how much it will cost?"
"60k per year.


but usually these drugs are available by asian companies for tens of dollars soon after release of the drugs. i got tofacitinib for 25 euro per month. unfortunately it didn't work for my condition ðŸ™ƒ"

"i am french but on adalimumab (started last week). i donâ€™t know about rinvoq prescriptions but i can only say that youâ€™ll get it for Â«Â freeÂ Â» if you work here (healthcare system is good).
by the way, you can make an online consultation with a doctor using the app Â«Â doctolibÂ Â». thatâ€™s the french online platform for booking medical appointments. you just have to choose Â«Â teleconsultationÂ Â» and find a gastroenterologist who is available and book the online appointment.
if you come to paris, the saint antoine hospital is the best hospital for digestive diseases.
the second one is Â«Â pitiÃ© salpÃªtriÃ¨reÂ Â».
i am being treated for crohnâ€™s disease at saint-antoine hospital."
thank you so much. i wasn't aware there were options to book online consultations. my insurance covers any medical care in france (ill be in geneva) so this is extremely helpful.

"i first started adlimumab back in september last year when i was also at the last 4 weeks of so of a pred course. my worst symptoms at the time were arthritis related (tends to be the most debilitating for me) but my bowels were also not great - the immediate relief that i had the day after my first doses was actually quite unbelievable. zero joint pain and felt less fatigue. 
the combo of the pred and biologics helped get things under control i think. sadly i then got covid and had some very stressful events happen which kicked me back into a flare in jan. 
the bowel stuff for me is now pretty under control and i put that down to the adlimumab - joints still pretty bad but iâ€™m on methotrexate now too for that. 

so, itâ€™s worked for me, but itâ€™s the also the first biologic iâ€™ve been on so donâ€™t have much comparison"
"sounds promising! i will find out pretty fast it seems haha.

thank you for sharing, glad to hear you're doing well!"
yeah hopefully you have a similar experience - i have to say the joint pain was an easy thing to have immediate comparison of like canâ€™t move to zero aches, and the bowel stuff maybe took another week or so, so if itâ€™s not immediate donâ€™t panic. itâ€™s different for everyone and usually takes around 5 months to really get the gears turning consistently.
thanks for the newsflash i look forward to it every week keep up the great work.
just want to add another question here cause im interested in that medication. what is the success rate of rinvoq? i am in the military and despairatly want a medication to work without going biologics or i'm gonna get kicked out. thanks
i had some changes for the first week or so. six months on rinvoq and everything is normal.
"can't speak to the success rate, but a couple study participants in our ibd flare study are on rinvoq. one has been on it for about a year if i recall correctly. they previously failed tons of drugs and rinvoq has worked for them, so if you similarly have failed lots of drugs, it may be a good option? the other person in the study just started rinvoq and a week in hadn't noticed a change, but it tends to take time and varies per person. they have ibd and joint pain (which is common with ibd).   
ibd is inflammatory bowel disease btw."
"i don't know what the success rate of rinvoq is, but i believe it is a biologic. (my brain is now doubting that so anyone correct me if i'm wrong!) it seems to work well for me at the moment, but i'm just one person and other peoples' experiences may differ of course.

in general though, you should talk to your rheumatology consultant about your worries, and about what medicine to go on next. they're the best person to advise you on this, and much better placed to do so than us here on reddit. good luck!"
thanks a lot for the answer
thank you. might you have any insight into arthritis (primary long term rheumatoid  with now secondary osteo) alongside ibs that seems to present more as ibs-c, but perhaps might be ibs-m? (specifically looking for insight into the ibs side, the arthritis info is just for context.)
"i used to think the same thing but rinvoq actually isn't a biologic, it's called a targeted synthetic dmard. 

biologics are synthesized from natural sources/living things (human/animal, microorganism, etc). we essentially isolate *something* from a living source that can inhibit certain molecules/receptors/cells/cytokines/etc, and make it into a drug.

while biologics and synthetic dmards inhibit something specific, conventional dmards don't have a specific target. they work to suppress your immune system in different ways (and we still don't fully understand the mechanisms). methotrexate, for example, is something called an antimetabolite, specifically it blocks purine metabolism which has downstream effects (suchs as inhibition of t cell activation) which suppress your immune system.

targeted synthetic dmards like rinvoq target something specific (janus kinase in the case of rinvoq, not actually sure if they make any for other diseases that target other molecules) but they aren't made from something living (which is why they're called synthetic lol)

i feel like it's often talked about like a biologic though and tbh i didn't know the difference until i took it last year and was reading more about it"
this isn't diagnostic info, but we did a dr. interview once with a rheumatologist who has some theories about ibd and osteoarthritis specifically. we've been too busy to do the video editing, but we'll post it on our socials (most likely instagram) as soon as we can. the clinician didn't mention ibs :/ if you'd like to reach out to the physician, you can reach out to us in the dm's and we can pass along their info. they're based in berkeley, ca. sorry i couldn't be more help, but hopefully we have more insights after our flare study!
"huh, okay, very interesting. til - thank you for eaching! 

rinvoq has seemed to get equated with biologics to me, but perhaps i'd just not asked the right questions about it at my rheumatology appointments. thanks for the clarifications!"
hi :) thank you for the info so far. i'll look you up on socials for following along on further info. meanwhile i will reach out for the doctor's info - always worth asking for more views on this stuff.
i was on 30 mg for 90 days; some relief from joint pain but not enough so my rheum switched me. no side effects whatsoever. wish i couldâ€™ve stayed on it!
"it was meh for me. i never really got a good result. i only took it for a couple of months. it gave me severe acne (and some turned to hidradenitis suporativa). i still can't get to stop breaking out. it's been over seven months since i've quit the rinvoq. i can't tackle the acne despite salicylic acid soaps, etc. i never had acne prior to using this product. and the darn wounds from some of the acne turn into psoriasis patches.

watch out for the acne. i wish you much luck with ur health & the rinvoq. i genuinely hope it helps you."
how is the safety profile in comparison to cosentyx and taltz? iâ€™d like to. at be switch to rinvoq as well. on humira o definitely got more colds, but not on cosentyx. but cosentyx only helps like 50% on my pain and still canâ€™t close hands etc
"it's working pretty well for me. i've been on it for maybe a year? i'm not good with time.

the majority of my symptoms are pain. the few psoriasis symptoms i've had seem to be controlled.

the rinvoq works better for my hands than xeljanz, but not as well for my hips. the doc added plaquenil to work on that.

hope you have good luck with it."
i'm currently in rinvoq, has been abkut 6 months i think. i can't tell if it works or if i'm in a really bad flare. no side effects though, so there's that.
it changed my life. humira did nothing for me.
facebook has a very active rinvoq users and support page. lots of information
i was on it for six months and if anything it made both my joints and skin worse. sadly the worst biologic iâ€™ve been on, but only taking a pill once a day was way nicer than injections.
"it did well for me but gave me massive stomach issues, despite taking with a stomach protector.  indefestion, diarrhoea that lasted days, cramps. for me that was worse than the actual psa.

it really cleared my flaky face though."
itâ€™s working well for me, been on it about a year. no ongoing side effects, decent pain control. was some gastrointestinal issues when starting but only lasted a few weeks and not terrible, just inconvenient. i did get slightly better control on xeljanz (another jak inhibitor) but had constant chest infections and had to stop it. rinvoq has been the good middle ground.
i hope you can find something that works well for you!
i never really get acne either so praying this doesnâ€™t affect me much but thankyou and i hope you find whatâ€™s right for you and combat your skinðŸ˜Š
oh yeah, i second the acne, itâ€™s a pain. not worth stopping in my case as the rinvoq is working but it is a downside.
i was just swapped from cosentyx and i was just so unwell all the time it didnâ€™t work for me my pain is also at the worst itâ€™s been  but hopefully the rinvoq works and maybe you will be able to speak to someone about it only doing some relief for you and be able to get some more helpðŸ˜Š
thankyou!! glad youâ€™ve been able to get some relief hopefully i can to!
what class of drug is plaquenil?
hopefully you get more relief soonðŸ¤žðŸ»
iâ€™m so pleased for you! iâ€™m hoping same for me
thankyou! iâ€™m quite nervous to post or reply on fb due to facebooks info and reddit is private ðŸ˜Š but i will see if there is any info i can read there
i am glad no injections and all just tablets so thatâ€™s a plus for me
it's hydroxychloroquine--you know, the "magic covid cure." per the american college of rheumatology, it's a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (dmard). it can decrease the pain and swelling of arthritis. (either nothing is going to work on my hips, or i'm flaring. for a long time.)
understandable; there are a ton of posts and you can get a lot of info just be reading through and searching.
"oh haha covid cute

okay that's interesting, that's good that it's helping you!"
it looks like aloysius o'hare.
the way they have the commercial actors "double up" on that visually repairing the colon lining part is extra creepy. like it's their favorite part. ðŸ‘€
what does the bottle look like it's wearing a trucker cap?
something about the way they always show these people eating makes me want to punch all of them.
and, they've gone from "rin-vuck!" to "check, check, check, check and check," so there's that.
they want to see your colon lining.
"my daughter started rinvoq 8 weeks ago. she has now dropped from 45mg to 30mg. this is the only treatment that has worked for her after failing steroids, mesalazine, mercaptopurine, infliximab. she noticed a positive change in symptoms after a week of taking riviq and a dramatic improvement within 4 weeks. sheâ€™s now able to add foods she used to avoid back into her diet such as raw fruit and veg without it causing a problem.Â 
she had been in a flare for 2 years since diagnosis. she never went into remission. her pan colitis was so severe that if she failed rinvoq, she was facing surgery at age 14.Â 
we are thankful that rinvoq worked for her, we are just praying its keeps on working long term."
rinvoq uber alles
best decision my doctor made for my change of medication. itâ€™s given me my life back.
good luck:)
nice rinvoq is great!
"all the bestâ€¦.i started rinvoq 8 weeks ago, after inflectra failed â€¦so far so good it has worked great â€¦i started on 45 mg and after 8 weeks went to 15.
oh and ps i had problems with the cap also!"
are the pills pretty easy to swallow? i had a rough time with the mesalamine monsters. might be swapping to this in the near future, as stellara has helped, but it hasnâ€™t put me in full remission.
"watch your cholesterol and start an anti acne routine 

good luck"
thatâ€™s amazing! i am so happy to hear itâ€™s going well and i hope it continues. iâ€™m so encouraged when i hear stories like that and tough cases that do well! i have had pancolitis for 11 years- the first several it was mostly controlled with mesalamine and steroids as needed, then things escalated in 2022. i failed entyvio and most recently, zeposia. iâ€™m so thankful that there are new meds coming out all the time but switching is tough! your daughter is a trooper- wishing you both the very best of continued outcomes.
iâ€™m so happy to hear that! i hope i have similar results. how long have you been taking it?
hahaha! i am glad i am not the only one that was having trouble with the cap. even more glad you are doing so well- hope it continues! i am about to take my second dose and am already seeing improvement. this is wild!
also, good luck! hope there is good food, and comfort in the near future for you.
i have been taking apriso, and those are pretty huge! this is definitely smaller than that. i was on zeposia before this and it definitely helped a lot, but i still had inflammation at my scope a few weeks ago.
thank you! my dr did a lipids panel since it had been a few years, and mine had already crept up so he put me on a statin to be safe. iâ€™ll be ready for the zits if they happen!
"thankyou, she has been so brave and itâ€™s painful to watch someone so young go through this. rinvoq really has given her young life back and has also been the one with the least side effects after the initial fatigue wore off. it is important to share the highs as well as the lows to give people some optimism for the future, i really needed that when she was so unwell and it all seems so hopeless. her consultant is reassuring that more treatments are coming through as they understand the condition better.Â 
i really hope you find a treatment that works for you too."
iâ€™ve been taking it almost 2 years
oh my gosh, me too! thanks so much and for you as well!
"perfect 
good luck!"
"iâ€™m not sure itâ€™ll be equivalent to what youâ€™ve gone through, but growing up, my eczema was really, really bad. my dermatologist had me try literally, every. single. cream. ever. 

we used to have a glass container that held every single tube of cream. it would be the same thing - each new cream would work a for a month, maybe 2, then iâ€™d start being resistant to it. iâ€™m talking hundreds of creams. i still have the image of that glass container in my head. 

i was put on dupixent about 5 years ago and itâ€™s been a saving grace. it doesnâ€™t work for everyone, thatâ€™s very true. i would definitely check out adbry if rinvoq doesnâ€™t help. adbry is a branch off of dupixent. it didnâ€™t work for me but we are all different when it comes to our eczema. 

i hope the best for you on rinvoq!"
"rinvoq is kind of working for me, but you're right, it's a systemic problem. if i was just given 2 months to live in a mold-free, pet-free (no rooommates) environment without having the threat of homelessness hanging over my head things would be very different for me. instead i lost my stressful tech job, fell deep into poverty, and qualified for the ""we feel bad watching you die, so the pharma company has agreed to give you some free medicine"" medical plan.

when you factor in the taxes lost from going from making 50k a year to under 20k, the cruelty of the system is fucking over everyone, even those that genuinely would be ok with me just dying."
"uhhh i'm not sure about your anger at the (presumably) doctors you've seen who tried antiinflammatories with you. it sounds like they started mild and tried things, working up from the mildest to the strongest, trying different med classes along the way. what else should they have done? this is what is available, it's what exists to try to help you.

there's no magic solution, they're not withholding the real answer from you. you have a difficult to treat inflammatory condition. your skin isn't talking, your immune cells cannot be asked why they're acting up.

i completely understand being exasperated by the whole thing, but getting aggro toward people trying to help you isn't going to do anything productive for your situation. it's not their fault that the condition is not fully understood or curable.

did you try seeing a rheumatologist? it sounds like your inflammation is beyond eczema, like there's more going on."
my dermatologist was very honest and said "we honestly just want to pump patients with drugs because its the fastest solution" which is true, theyâ€™re just hiding the symptoms instead of solving them.
"i'll cut my long story short, anxiety and stress can manifest in the body, and cause inflamation ..and trigger eczema, and all other types of various health problems. right now my eczema is under control, but it is coming out as canker sores.  and when you're fuckingmiserable from the eczema and none of the meds are working, and they can be expensive, that certainly just adds to that. stress and [anxiety cause inflamation](https://www.healthline.com/health/atopic-dermatitis/can-seeing-a-therapist-help-with-eczema).   before you consider yet another medicine, [discuss this link with your docs.](https://nationaleczema.org/eczema-emotional-wellness/) because controlling triggers physical and mental that cause the [flare ups is so importan](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/eczema/insider/severe-atopic-dermatitis)t. and living with eczema is no breeze.  any doctor who is just giving your rx after rx without even looking at it form this angle is   
 a dick [may you get some relief soon](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/eczema/insider/severe-atopic-dermatitis)  hopefully they can find a combination of a rx and some type of talk therapy to get you there, and you'll only have to use the meds every blue moon"
"i highly recommend elimination diet.

carnivore can be good, but requires a lot of research before trying so you know what to do and how to react to your signals. for me it did help a lot with healing my gut, but after a while i couldnâ€™t afford to keep myself on just high grade meat and after i went on to groundbeef my skin started reacting, so i switched to anti-inflammatory diet recommended by a friend who has had eczema as a child."
"same, like what the actual fuck.

i feel like western medecine is a scam. they want you on many drugs so they can make the most money.

so i left western medecine et went into ayurevedic medecine.

slowly improving..."
"i've never had a cream work at all.  as my dermatologist put it, i've failed the steroid creams.  best relief was a massive steroid dose for a very nasty asthma attack.  i'm talkng 250 mg initially and 60mg a day for 10+ day.  my skin healed...for a bit before it went back to its nonsense. at least the sore spots healed enough to stop bleeding!

i've done dupixent, and i don't think it did anything for me.  i am now taking a different injection for my asthma, and my eczema has improved, which seems suspicious."
all that including dupixent didnt work on me. in fact dupixent reacted so horribly with me that i havent been able to get back to my skin before using it. luckily rinvoq has been working for me in terms of calming my itch down and keeping me more stable. its not a wonder drug like they portrayed dupixent to be. my skin hasnt just cleared up and turned baby smooth like they promised. but im happy with rinvoq when i can get it, at least it stabilizes me enough to where i feel like i can actually leave my home and hit the gym some days.
"two words: dupixent and opzelura

talk to your doctor about these medicines. it changed my life."
i do t have a lot to add, but get a biopsy done to get some real data if you havenâ€™t already.
now you are a patient i would love to have on an oral anti-fungal.  it has an 87% success rate in dyshidrosis, hand and feet eczema.
oh my gosh iâ€™m in the exact same position as you right now. eczema is all over my face and neck and arms. derms gave me topical steroids and i eventually wen on dupixent but it stopped working after a few months. they wanted me to go on rinvoq but i also got a second opinion from another derm and she said that rinvoq doesnâ€™t last that long and eventually patients have to resort to something different after ðŸ˜­. so now iâ€™m just letting my eczema ride out and hope it heels by itself because i have given up on doctors
elimination diet (start out carnivore). also i love body biome's tallow cream with added colloidal oatmeal. doing going to try adding nettle next
everything changed for me when i went to an allergist instead of a dermatologist. did 3 years of allergy shots and havenâ€™t had eczema since.
i was on the medical trials for rinvoq for 5 years. actual miracle. my eczema was so bad i couldnâ€™t go out, i couldnâ€™t walk without pain, or ever felt confident. hoping that it does for u what it did for me ðŸ˜©
you have to take back your life, restart. do a (safe) 3 day fast (do research and make sure you get electrolytes) your body after the third day starts repairing itself from the inside out. goodluck. you have a right to be mad.
"...until rinvoq triggers shingles.

...hope that doesn't happen to you, but i and the same journey and, yeah, that happened ðŸ«£"
"itâ€™s an overgrowth of staph bacteria on your eczema. basically a chronic bacterial infection that once addressed, your skin can heal and go into remission. 

gladskin lotion is a good first thing to try, money back guarantee. kills the staph with an enzyme and allows the good bacteria of the skin microbiome to re colonize which strengthens your skin against future flares. 

ultimately it wasnâ€™t enough at first to clear my son, and i started him on dr. richard aronâ€™s regimen and his skin is now in remission and heâ€™s off the topical compound. now i keep his skin stable with gladskin and dead sea salt baths. 

yes eczema is forever, but if you keep the staph burden down, which is what causes the itching and redness, your skin will remain healthy and it wonâ€™t react to environmental stressors. 

also, people often forget that your skin is your largest organ, so when it is infected, itâ€™s impacting most systems in your body."
they used you as a guinea pig without any doubt. the best thing you can do is stop taking any drug that has corticosteroids. i know tsw can be hard and practically incapacitate you for years, but it's the only way to cleanse yourself of that sh-t and get healthy again.
"i am/was in the exact same situation you are. 30+ years of the most potent steroid creams overused at doctors and dermatologists advise. my skin is destroyed and the worst itâ€™s ever been. even the strongest steroid creams donâ€™t do anything or just create an extreme rebound. 

dupixent failed. if anything i got worse. 

currently on rinvoq and itâ€™s been the only thing thatâ€™s worked. however, now my cholesterol has spiked massively and my liver enzymes have been elevated. i fear theyâ€™ll take me off it. and then iâ€™ll be back to a miserable existence of being bedbound, unable to work, depressed, and in agony 24/7. sounds about my luck - finally find something that at least makes daily life have some sort of quality to it, and then i get the dangerous side effects and probably have to go off the medication.

majorly sucks."
word. i canâ€™t even imagine the phone calls you mustâ€™ve gone through with insurance as well. i just had a 4 hour phone call to get my fuckin billing squared away after switching jobs and insurance. otherwise my copay woulda been $2.5k
iâ€™m so sorry!!! do you have dustmite covers on your bed and pillows? this is so true- i had the allergies too. had to replace and cover my sleeping stuff, start taking ldn (<3 for eczema and the allergies, but long term), hypochlorus acid and deal with a lot of environmental stuff, cleaning wise; the assumption it was just regular eczema and a single magical topical cream would work. honestly made things so much worse.
rinvoq 30mg and double dosing when 80%+ flair is best ive had without strong oral steroids.
"i feel your pain (literally), tried so many drugs, solutions, etc. after many frustrating attempts, iâ€™m finally experiencing some relief â€” with saniderm/tattoo aftercare bandages (from amazon, but perhaps tattoo parlors sell these as well, for quicker access?). i just applied them directly to my eczema, and almost immediately the extreme itchiness and irritation subsided, but i found this post that explains how another user adds ointments/other products first under the bandages: https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/s/ffjhpqfulu 

ultimate test will be sleeping tonight, to see if i can finally make it more hours without being awakened by maddeningly itchy skin. anyway, thought these transparent bandages might be worth a shot for you; best of luck!"
"i am in the same boat as you, and i remember being this angry initially. however, this anger is counterproductive - stress aggravates my eczema further. we just happen to be one of the unlucky ones to have a problem that we(and even the professionals) aren't able to figure out why.   
i totally get the frustration and exasparation. however, being mad at people who are trying to help doesn't solve anything.maybe try to make your peace with this instead of going on a blame game might help, it helped me for sure."
lets go bro, its all from within, fuck external shit. grasp the power of your mind and life and take life by its balls and win brother.
"i have had eczema since birth. here's my advice


i too was on the steroid road and suffered through steroid withdrawal it lasted a couple months and was torture. never again.

go the naturopath route. it has calmed down my eczema and flare ups tremendously. i cut out dairy, eggs, nuts and most important alcohol! i also try and lessen the amount of sugar i eat, but i don't cut it out completely. i firmly believe that your gut health is a huge reason why eczema comes and stays for so long. look into eating a gut health diet. i had allergy tests done for food and nothing came back but i know that the foods above trigger a flare up.

i take vitamins and minerals and notice a difference in my skin if i forget to take them for a couple days. my iron especially (i've been anemic my whole life and just put 2 and 2 together, but i got flare ups when i wasn't taking my iron) i take zinc, vitamin d, biotin, fish oil and a probiotic as well. obviously speak to your doctor or naturopath for prolonged use. i've been on them regularly for only 2 months now. 

also i was living with a relative who was very cluttered and clutter = dust. after moving and having less things everywhere i notice less dust n allergic reactions. sneezing, itching etc.. minimalist decor it is for me. try it out if your able.

if you want my skincare recommendations i can add those as well :) best of luck to you and your skin â¤ï¸"
i personally got tired of being prescribed different topical creams. most of the time once i'd get prescribed a drug it would work for some time and then it seemed like my body would get used to it and it would stop working and make my flare ups worse than before. i got tired and i decided to try something organic and experiment with it, i gave up at this point so i was just trying it out without high expectations. home-made neem oil helped cure my scalp eczema after a period of using it for over 5 months. the burning sensation & itchiness started to reduce gradually and my scalp stopped flaking ( i had flakes the size of a coin and bigger all over my scalp) i found the recipe on youtube. i hope this helps but be patient with it, in the long run it's worth it i started using it in 2020 and now i see a huge difference.
this is what my derm did with me, i was on rinvoq. while it was very good, it lost about half of its effectiveness and i wanted to try something else. i already tried dupixent so they put me on adbry.
"what is their fault is not identifying that a rash coming back after stopping topical steroid use is topical steroid withdrawal, and not a need for more steroids. 

the reason itâ€™s this bad now is because my topical steroid use was continuous, at the direction of the derms. it probably wouldâ€™ve been fine if they actually made my parents aware of the terrorizing side effects of prolonged steroid use, and that theyâ€™re better off using cortisone for a couple weeks and then stopped. i would've ""outgrown"" it like normal people.

they're the reason i am in this predicament. 

re: rheumatologist - yes. got bloodwork. mild positive ana nonspecific. theyâ€™re shrugging their fucking shoulders at me just the same as the derms. no one cares that iâ€™m basically homeless thanks to this ailment."
what else are they supposed to do? you can talk about and address allergies and triggers all you want, at the end of the day, eczema is currently incurable and treatment is largely symptom management instead of actually curing it outright
how's this been? i'm starting by cutting wheat, dairy, eggs, and peanuts for now.
doctors donâ€™t get paid for prescribing more drugs in 90% of western countries
dupixent also helps for asthma
"op said they tried dupixent but failed it.

i failed dupixent too. 5 months on it, no improvement at all. itâ€™s a miracle drug, but unfortunately doesnâ€™t work for everyone. 

heard good things about opzelura. not available in australia yet unfortunately."
tell me more!-!!!?
[deleted]
i fasted with a certified practitioners oversight for 5 days, and maybe itâ€™s just the unlucky change of seasons having an effect at the same time, but my skins never been worse in the month since lol. rest of my body felt great though!!
"did the eczema from staph look different from normal eczema? mines changed over the last year, from red weeping raised bumpy skin, to dry scratched up skin with some inflamed patches. trying to research if itâ€™s just eczema going weird on different body parts eg shoulders and back, or tsw, or an infection. 
if only my dermatologist was interested in helping me find out vs so focused on setting me on the path to duxiprent."
the good news is that for most of the people that have spikes in their labs, it normalizes with continued use. hope it works out.
[deleted]
"you're not describing tsw. you are describing an uncontrolled inflammatory disorder. when you stop treating, it makes sense that the inflammation worsens. 

i'm not sure what to make of this story, other than you're upset at your condition, which is understandable. i think you have misplaced anger, though. 

tyou have an incurable condition, the best you can hope for is control of the symptoms to a level that will enable you to live your life. you might never be totally free of symptoms. or maybe you will some day, who knows. there are always studies being done to try to figure this out. 

have you seen a therapist? i suspect you need to work on positive coping strategies. i'm not minimizing your concerns. on the contrary -- dealing with this problem is hard. it's not something that just comes naturally but there are strategies that can help."
a rash coming back after stopping steroid use is expected if the environmental triggers are still present, it isnâ€™t necessarily tsw.
[deleted]
yes, it does.  i had started dupixent for asthma originally, and it stopped working for my asthma. i switched from dupixent to tezspire, which is marketed for asthma but not eczema.  i am a severe asthmatic and have been for over 7 years.  the last 6 months, my frequency of asthma attacks requiring er visits had gone from 1 every 6 months to 2-4 a month.
need to get on a medical cohort trial.  www.dyshidrosis.co.uk
"you take shots for 3-5 years. they say you may have to do another round years down the road, it just depends on how your body responds and adapts. 

i also noticed my eczema went away when i did keto, years before the allergy shots."
"thanks. appreciate the comment. iâ€™m praying thatâ€™s the case too. 

iâ€™ve been on it a year so i was worried that itâ€™s been a bit too long for labs to be still very high. however my cholesterol was relatively high before starting rinvoq. and my gp put me on a statin 3 months ago so i havenâ€™t tested since starting them. and iâ€™ve heard liver enzymes can fluctuate pretty regularly on blood tests.

got bloods done wednesday and have a phone consult with gp next week for results so fingers crossed itâ€™s improved."
"the permanent solution is to figure out your triggers and avoid them.

allergy testing is paramount to this. also i've just begun an elimination diet. will likely move geographic region to avoid my environmental factors (my triggers are highly prevalent where i currently live, and less prevalent in other parts of the country). i want to avoid exhausting all pharmaceutical options so early in my journey."
itâ€™s great youâ€™ve found something that works for you! gives the rest of us hope :)
i second the vitamin e oil ! actually is the only thing that can go on open wounds (from eczema) that doesnâ€™t sting. a major plus is it helps me not scar
[deleted]
even with allergy testing, which yielded nothing i didnâ€™t already know, i still canâ€™t figure out my triggers. itâ€™s very frustrating.
keto wasnâ€™t sustainable for me long-term. i opted for immunotherapy because i went into respiratory failure and was on life support for a week, in part because of the severe allergies and asthma that i no longer have. the eczema going away was an unexpected bonus.
what did it yield? edit: also, food triggers are finicky. you can be reacting to a food group and it wonâ€™t show up on an allergen test.
[deleted]
itâ€™s been awhile but ragweed, slightly to dogs but not enough that really bothers me, cats, and some other grasses. i havenâ€™t done a food allergy test though. i do need to get that done
iâ€™ve never used dupixent. i did allergy shots (immunotherapy) through my allergist, which is formulated for what each individual patient is allergic to.
[might need to consider moving.](https://airpurifiers.com/allergies/what-state-has-no-ragweed/#:~:text=alaska%2c%20hawaii%2c%20and%20oregon%20all%20have%20very%20low,compared%20to%20other%20parts%20of%20the%20united%20states.)
[deleted]
i live in georgia so itâ€™s not the worst but not the best. usually only in the spring too
"correct, but it was environmental allergies, not food. i was allergic to  everything on the prick test. before immunotherapy i was chronically illl and needed an inhaler to breathe. now i donâ€™t need any meds, and the last time i was sick was when i was on life support 3 years ago. immunotherapy is expensive but it has been life changing for me personally.

edit: and yes, the eczema has gone away too. iâ€™d still have little patches pop up during years 1 and 2 of the shots, but they were mild. itâ€™s been a year now since iâ€™ve had eczema. it usually flares in the winter but nothing this year."
"step 1 of colorectal surgery is an end-ileostomy with appliance (bag) that you get to try before you buy it. there's no rush to get subsequent surgeries. if you decide to keep the end-ileostomy then you will need a barbie/ken butt surgery to remove the remaining rectum and close up back there, a surgery that's a slow recovery. most proceed to a j-pouch, but a minority do keep the ileostomy. it's a younger person's disease and we worry about body image, dating, etc etc and the j-pouch is preferred for that reason.Â 


if you decide to proceed to a j-pouch, then you have a second surgery to get a loop-ileostomy with appliance and form the j-pouch (but not attach it). surgery 3 is the takedown surgery and you leave with a functioning j-pouch and no more appliance. l


most patients who have a j-pouch or end-ileostomy with appliance are able to conceive naturally and have a healthy baby. know delivery is always a c-section after you've had colorectal surgery.Â 


any surgery risks causing difficulty conceiving, they're working close to our reproductive organs but be as careful as surgeons are they can.Â  the risk is the formation of adhesions, a type of scar tissue that glues organs together, to the abdominal cavity etc. adhesions can prevent an egg from traveling down to be fertilized , by strangling the fallopian tubes.


Â  if you cannot conceive naturally then ifv is successful.Â Â 


life with a j-pouch means having to poop 4-6 times a day, roughly evenly spaced over 24 hours. poops are quick and painless without any urgency, at most yogurt in consistency. it mostly aligned with frequency most people pee, so they empty their j-pouch and pee simultaneously and it takes the same amount of time.Â 


generally with any colorectal surgery, you can eat almost anything you want. know some foods might produce more output than others, and some do use imodium on an ongoing basis to slow things down. generally frequency is highest after the surgery, but things slow down after a series of months. with an end ileostomy, chew foods well and be careful of things that might cause a blockage at the stoma, like whole popcorn kernels as an example."
"always remember, once its out u cant go back. it wont be instantly better, you will just move your colitis to pouchitis. 
remeber, you have still a lot of medicine to go, proper diet plans, workouts etc etc.
listen to your doctor and use it only if it has to be your last hope.
stay strong, you got this!"
the ostomy and j-pouch subreddits are good places to hear about the surgeries and peopleâ€™s experiences. i had my colon removed around four years ago and my rectum/anus removed in february this year. so i have a permanent ileostomy. i got mine for quality of life reasons while i still had medication left to try. itâ€™s a personal decision and i agree that itâ€™s an alternative treatment not a last resort, my doctors said the same thing. my ileostomy has been great, i can eat what i want and itâ€™s very easy to manage. i had to get the rectum removed as it was non stop inflamed after surgery. i have had a complication from my proctectomy as iâ€™ve had my vagina and uterus falling into the space my rectum was in. itâ€™s mainly been a problem during my period, the blood doesnâ€™t come out normally and i have to go to the bathroom and sort of push it out. the fertility complications can happen with j-pouch or proctectomy surgery. but you can delay those surgeries till after you have kids. iâ€™m personally very glad i had the surgeries as my life is way better now, but itâ€™s was a difficult decision to make at the time. i hope your quality of life improves whatever route you take.
i believe there is aother subreddit for collectomy and one for jpouch, you might get more answers there.  i wish you all the best no matter what decision you ultimately make. i'm sure it can't be easy.
"20f, going for a j pouch but have an ostomy right now (love it, just not sustainable for me long term). i had severe acute uc for six years, and had failed seven drugs at that point. my motivation was that i knew my body just wouldnâ€™t be able to make it through trying another medication and i completely made the right call as my colon tore the night before surgery lmfao (so great timing). life has been wonderful with my ostomyâ€” i have no pain, am able to eat what i want, am able to leave my house, and donâ€™t have to spend half my day in the bathroom anymore. i coordinate bag covers with my outfits and my partners havenâ€™t had any issue with it :) 

however i will say that doctors had been pushing me for surgery for about three years before i got it. i did see it as a last resort and tried medication after medication. it is obviously your choice completely, but although youâ€™ve failed three medications there are several others out there that may give you relief for several years. i donâ€™t regret the three years i had in and out of remission. 

if you see surgery as something that is inevitable, i would say get it sooner rather than later as the younger and healthier you are, the easier recovery is. 

best of luck with whatever you decide!"
you haven't tried any inmunosupressant like azathioprine?, that drug is nice and helps me a lot, i also suffer of proctosigmoiditis
we have a choice? i thought thatâ€™s up to the doctors/surgeons.
"i have had uc since i was 9. now 27f having my colectomy july 9th because after 10 medications and a continuous flare for the last 5 years, i just canâ€™t do it anymore. i considered it last year but decided to hold out for 2 more meds. youâ€™ll know when youâ€™re finally ready because even knowing that i may hate the ostomy, itâ€™s worth not having to deal with my current situation. 

iâ€™ll report back!"
"i was diagnosed in my early 30's with ulcerative proctitis, it was tough to hear but luckily i only flare once every few years. 

i remember the dr who diagnosed me saying that the best treatment is to get medication directly to the affected area. he put me on canasa suppositories and one time rowasa enema, both are mesalamine. they worked fast.

back then there were no generics and canasa was over $800 for 30 day supply. thankfully now there is mesalamine generic 1000mg which i use when needed. i clear up in a few days using 1x at night but continue for 2-3 weeks and am back to normal.

might be worth asking dr about or researching. i actually prefer those over taking pills every day. best of luck!"
i have a friend with a j pouch who has 2 kids, no fertility issues at all. please get a second opinion on that part.
get a 2nd opinion. of course everybody is different but now thereâ€™s good news from uk saying theyâ€™ve found the gene that causes it (only time will tell) i have a j-pouch since 2011 and havenâ€™t been in remission for almost 20 yearsâ€¦
thank you so much for this detailed and informative response.
if golds still existed iâ€™d give you one now ðŸ¥¹
just wanted to say, great post and very informative. btw do most people stay on meds after j pouch and is it biologics or just mesalazine?
thank you, it just gets a bit much sometimes so i appreciate your comments
"i'm currently in this situation now. thank u for your post â™¡ 

my quality of life is so poor :( 6 years loads of different drugs i asked if it's an option and they said yes so now waiting x"
thank you, i'll take a look
i was taking azathioprine alongside the infliximab and it didn't help unfortunately
my doctors said i could choose it at any time. but i had to have lots of appointments to make sure it was the right choice and there was an inter-department meeting of my doctors and surgeon to decide if they thought it was right for me. iâ€™m in scotland with the nhs, so i donâ€™t know if it works differently in other countries.
i've been sporting a jpouch for 25 years.  i miss being "normal" but i love being alive.  i think you can have kids after jpouch reconstruction.  you will definitely feel much better.  as my surgeon said, your colon is but an organ or convenience.  nobody would choose this but when you're that sick something has to give.  i wish nobody got delt uc cards but it appears that's just nothing we can control.  i do know that i would much rather have a touch than a colostomy bag.  3 months with one was good enough.  stay strong!
good luck â™¡
"after a colorectal surgery you're generally off of meds (unless you need to safely taper down pred).Â 


Â until step #3 of j-pouch, or barbie/ken butt surgery for a kept end-ileostomy, you do still have uc within the rectum that remains disconnected up top. no longer passing waste often calms down uc left.Â  accordingly, some might need mesalamine or corticosteroid suppositories if it flares up."
i have a permanent ileostomy and you dont have pouchitis problems with that one just so you consider that aswell
good luck with your surgery. even with my complication my life is still much better than it was before. i woke up from the first surgery already feeling better. i hope it goes well for you.
i have a questionâ€¦ iâ€™m a gay man who is going through something similar. can i still have anal sex after all of this or is that no longer an option after surgery?
i would think it'd be fine after the surgery has fully healed. in the event you need a colorectal surgery i would ask the surgeon when you could use could safely use toys and etc back there, any restrictions, etc.

hopefully this can help you ...will you please post your results one way or the other
a lot of doctors wonâ€™t prescribe it as itâ€™s for a different condition which is bs . iâ€™ve read a thing about how you qualify to get this treatment . no other treatments are working and 10% or more of your body must be covered which seems ridiculous. 10% of the face is worse than 10% of the body surely. hopefully some will get a chance to test and tell ðŸ¤žðŸ¼
itâ€˜s so expensive :(
i'll try to request this on the nhs and see what the crack is.
seems like a really serious drug from looking it up. those side effects are pretty crazy
this is interesting! but eczema is not caused by the yeast, right?
what sort of cost are you talking
it sounds like it could be benificial for sd...in theory like...do you have sd yourself
makes me never want to try it even if it is finally a â€œcureâ€
sd is not caused by the yeast either.  it's caused by your auto-immune system overreacting to the yeast.  everybody has the yeast.  so if it works on eczema like described, in theory it should work for sd too.
i totally agree but the yeast has a part to play in the bodies inflammatory response and this new treatment helps prevent the inflammatory response ...indirectly this could possibly help with sd...i'm just keeping my fingers crossed
"yep, diagnosed by a dermatologist who is also my gp. i've gone through pretty much every steroid cream you can think of, and anti-fungal too. went on an anti-fungal tablet for two months (with weekly bloodtests) and it didn't touch it either.

it started on my face when i was 30, so had it the past 3-4 years, although had it in my hair since i was a teen."
"youâ€™re right. 
i have no knowledge whatsoever on auto-immune diseasesâ€™ mechanisms. but op said â€œblocking the enzyme that causes the body to attack itselfâ€. is that the same enzyme for all auto-immune diseases? or at least the same one with eczema and seb derm? i know jak inhibitors are used for alopecia areata too, also an auto-immune disease. very interesting drug."
do you know why in some people their auto-immune system reacts to the yeast while others donâ€™t? is it just genetics?
"same, i was diagnosed at 30 and iâ€™m almost 35, shit sucks. 

canâ€™t sure it but thereâ€™s ways to keep it at bay sometimes."
try tacrolin0.1
try elidel or tacrolimus + moisturizer. it is safer long term, unlike steroid creams.
i don't know.  hopefully it is.
not a scientist, but i understand it is like many other allergies. we donâ€™t really understand why they come and go. iâ€™m also allergic to dust mites and used to be allergic to pets, but thatâ€™s no longer the case. some say it may have something with gut health. it is still quite misunderstood.
"just found this very recent case study report on jak inhibitor cream for sd: looks promising!

damn that sucks. living with sd has made life unbearable. iâ€™m just hoping thereâ€™s a breakthrough cure for this plague.
that's a lot of audio gear to fit in a buick.

also, you don't turn dials constantly (and seemingly randomly) while the song is playing. unless you're a complete idiot who doesn't know what they're doing. hmm, i think i may be onto something... lol
i hate this commercial, too. the music -- aaaarghh
thereâ€™s another drug commercial where a band teacher is directing a marching band. itâ€™s obvious to anyone who has ever directed a band or been a drum major, thatâ€™s not how you do it.

this one is driving me crazy lately! she looks like a soccer mom from the burbs.
she's a smokeshow mom dj.
lonely feminist dj who has time to dj because she blamed her skin condition on the patriarchy and suddenly finds herself childless, alone, and bitterâ€¦
she's hot. leave her alone.
she looks hot to me but i'm not gay so...
mom! get out of the dj booth! youâ€™re embarrassing meeeeeeee!
thatâ€™s so you.

lmao
can rinvoq help with that?
sheâ€™s leading the band and sheâ€™s marching in a parade of one. ðŸ¤£
i used to be in a marching band years ago, and my son was too. the actual director never led us in, was never part of the performance and only occasionally stood on the field. the football team never came out either or threw a football at the director. i wonder how many takes that was for her to catch it?
[audrey is on it with jardiance.](https://tenor.com/view/jardiance-jardiance-band-director-dance-dance-step-on-it-gif-15048004)
mixing them folk tunes like there's no tomorrow.
who is she - the actor?
she is! iâ€™ve tried looking up who she is but just get the actor on a helicopter.
it is.
iâ€™ll have to ask my doctor if rinvoq is right for me hahahaha
extended release mesalmine tablets.
"on entyvio for 5 years now. controls the gi symptoms really well but have more joint pain than on other meds. but still, would definitely take controlled gi symptoms any day! 

was on mesalamine for 6 years without issue until i got pregnant and then gave birth. had flare postpartum that didnâ€™t respond to prednisone and eventually we went on a biologic because of that.

on the bright side, have had 2 more children since and been on entyvio through both pregnancy and havenâ€™t had issues while pregnant or postpartum with either! yay!"
entyvio.
stelara
remicade. it has been a life saver for me, allows me to actually kind of feel like a normal person.
rinvoq
rinvoq
remicade only i'm doing really well i'm about 90% normal living
entyvio. iâ€™m at about 90 per cent. only drug to ever stop the bleeding (diagnosed 16 years ago).
just switched from mesalamine to entyvio. also on prednisone until the entyvio kicks in.
remicade and azathioprine. finally found something that can put me in remission.
entyvio
mesalamine pill and enema, budesonide pill awaiting approval for entyvio
why not a poll?
mesalamine. got me into remission
rinvoq 10 weeks. i started with 45 mg for first 8 weeks and now 30 mg maintenance dose. i was in a flare for 2 years. i had major stress that triggered my uc including the death of my childâ€™s father, serious family drama, getting married (try getting married in a flare in 90 degree weather on the beach lol) and relocating to a different town after growing up in the same town for 30 years. iâ€™m 90% better now. no more blood in my stool, less frequency and urgency.
stelara has me at about 80% too. also on methotrexate and colazide, add in mesalasine enemas when blood comes back maybe every 6 weeks or so.
mezavant
mezavant and remicade
xeljanz. not perfect but working better than inflectra, entyvio, stelara, and whatever else iâ€™ve been on (i honestly canâ€™t remember), and itâ€™s no copay for me. itâ€™s a twice-daily pill but i have other medications to take morning and night anyway so itâ€™s no more hassle than infusions and i donâ€™t have the issue of it wearing off two weeks before my next infusion/injection.
i'm taking a medication called filgotinib, so far it's been working really well
rinvoq.
rinvoq and so far so good!
stelara. iâ€™ve seen an improvement on it.
stelara, about 95% back to normal after a year and still improving. just have to stay hydrated and take a daily fiber pill, avoid alcohol and caffeine.
mesalamine and infliximab, tapering off pred
my child is on remicade and has been since she was 6. sheâ€™s 9 now and itâ€™s been working really well for her the whole time
19 years remicade only every 8 weeks
mesalamine. doing well so far and don't feel much difgerent than before
i'm on omvoh, a biologic, and prednisone.
zeposia. plus a short pred taper to offset a cdiff-spawned flare. other than that, zeposia has been fab.
on lialda for maintenance, currently on that and rowasa (mesalamine enema) while in my flare
pentasa granules (mesalamine), budenoside. just made the switch from entyvio to zeposia, i just havenâ€™t picked up the pills yet, as they've been ordered in from a different city.
lialda and entyvio and a ton of vitamins. had you asked me a few weeks ago before winter break, i'd have said 80%. now... 50%? on the mend.
remicade and in remission
"stelara, and both mesalamine pills and enemas. 

canâ€™t seem to ever stop the maintenance meds; my disease is relentless. getting approval to increase stelara dose to every six weeks, as drug levels are not quite where they need to be."
entyvio. it's worked miracles for me.
delzicol (mesalamine dr) and budesonide.
remicade
currently on prednisone (and vancomycin for c. diff), and going to be starting stelara hopefully v soon. tried apriso and things got exponentially worse so hoping that i respond better to the stelara!
adalimumab.
"imuran /
humira every 2 weeks /
budesonide 9mg daily"
infliximab (inflectra) and azathioprine. it seems to be working well.
lialda 4800mg
humira, prednisone, uceris foam, esomeprazole (technically for one of my other illnesses but helps the uc nausea), but i'm switching to entyvio soon.
inflectra - 90% good 90% of the time.
imuran
entyvio, had a terrible flare back in april last year, found out i didnâ€™t tolerate mesalamine, got on entyvio and was basically back to normal within 4-6 weeks
mesalamine suppositories are my maintenance medication.
been on sulfasalazine for a while. been working so far.
entyvio! it was the thing that finally stopped my year long flare, even after multiple rounds of steroids. was on mesalamine for over a decade until the flare started.
rinvoq and mesalasine!
entyvioâ€” three infusions in and i saw a lot of improvement with my first two (and my inflammation markers were down), but after my most recent iâ€™ve just been feeling crappy. overall love it though! i do get really bad headaches and joint/honestly all over arm and leg muscle pain, but it totally 10000% beats unbearable abdominal pain. still havenâ€™t had all of my bleeding quite disappear but hereâ€™s hoping! (iâ€™ve been on 3 pred tapers as well :))
lialda and mesalamine suppositories in remission
"mesalamine 
azathioprine 
humira"
rinvoq the goat
inflectra and methotrexate. they upped my inflectra to every 5 weeks recently because they felt like my inflammation markers were higher than they wanted but i feel great. inflectra has been a game changer for me.
if you can count qing dai as an herbal medication, that has fully put mine into remission. works great for about 30% of people. comes with some 1% risk of some rough side effects when used heavily over many years.
"iâ€™m also on humira, but the canadian version, hadlima.

whats going on with the other 20% if i may ask?"
iâ€™m on upadacitinib
used to take balsalazide for my uc.Â  then my doctor recommended me lialda.Â  had a negative reaction to the point i had to be hospitalized.Â Â  went back on balsalazide only to find out that whatever the lialda did effected me to the point that i can't take balsalazide anymore for it.Â  i'm working with my doctor but i might just have to have the infusions.
remicade and azathioprine, but itâ€™s not working. itâ€™s the first biological iâ€™ve tried but unfortunately not the one for me. tomorrow i will hear about the next step. just a little bit afraid as remicade seems to be the strongest biological already, but what works is different for everybody i guess.
yuflyma (adalimumab), mesalamine and mercaptopurine
pentasa, 2 grams/day (i'm in remission)
hyrimoz injections
humira, a miracle drug for me!
"too many medications. 

mazevant xl 4 tablets daily  
amgevita (humira) 80ml (two injections weekly)  
steroid foam enema's   


somehow still flaring! gah"
rinvoq x 5 months now.  back to 100%, just gotta lose the weight from steroids and i'll look like i did before if fluffing happened.  fingers crossed i keep this for years.
pentasa, 4 tabs a day for the past two years or so
iâ€™ve been on simponi over a decade now.
mesalazine, azathioprine and infliximab for me. keen to wean down but worried of a flare. it's a never ending battle!
been on avsola (remicade biosim) about a year now. i regained my life back id say. i'm never at my 100% but that's okay. my 80 is like someone's 100. so i can keep up with all the stuff i normally did before. there's times i actually do feel really good and normal but that's not very often. it's been happening more often lately. probably getting close to remission now. i have severe uc . jumped straight into biologics being a buck ten and useless lmao. i shot up to 185 on prednisone and avsola. tapered pred. now i'm at 165. i'm somewhat of a natural bodybuilder and i can now bench press 185 again. i actually look really good. almost as good as i did in my days before this. i imagine ill get there again some day but with some obstacles. all in all, i'm satisfied. take avsola every 8 weeks. i really want to try entivio. but we'll cross that bridge when it comes. i get joint pain and all that good stuff too. i just power through everything and never stop hitting the gym. keep in mind i know my body better than most. i work 12 hours a day too. so... take that to the bank i guess lmao.
i've been on oral mesalamine (2g 2x/day) since i was diagnosed in early 2019 and after my initial taper off of prednisone. added mesalamine enemas 3x/week in 2021 after a couple of small flares and now it's down to 2x/week and seems to be working well.
"daily:

2x mesalamine oral

3x budesonide oral

1x zeposia

1x mesalamine suppository"
entyvio and mesalamine dr
humira did'nt work for me......am on jyseleca now (filgotinib) seems to be working only 10 weeks in so fingers crossed.
my husband is on stelera and extended release mesalmine tabletsâ€¦.and iron. itâ€™s not perfect but itâ€™s working about 80-85% of the time.
"mesalamine and zeposia. 
mes was failing so switched to zeposia and they kept me on the mes too for some reason. 
zeposia works great havent flared or bled since starting."
remicade infusion every 8 weeks.  felt 100% better after 1st treatment.  fortunately, insurance covers it.
pentasa suppository here.
"humira sucked for me,so did stelara and now iâ€™m on remicade but pending surgery since i got blockages/strictures
so switching meds after biopsies results"
rinvoq
"iâ€™m been on mesalamine since day 1 of the diagnosis in 2003. pentasa, asacol ( been on it for the longest), delzicol (did not work), and due to insurance coverage changes, then lialda and then apriso. 

fun fact- takada, the manufacture of lialda, has a generous patient assistance program. i lost my job in september and qualify for free medicine, 90 dayâ€™s worth and delivered to my house."
entyvioâ€¦ itâ€™s been an actual godsend for me. my gi tried everything and just couldnâ€™t get control and then tried this and itâ€™s been going strong for almost 2 years.
remicade, getting an infusion as i type this.
mesalamine dr (lialda) + mercaptopurine (6mp).
iâ€™m currently on mesalamine and prednisone, but without any improvementâ€¦ doc gave me a few options. imurel, entyvio or xeljanzâ€¦ i have ehlers-danlos syndrome aswell, so a lot of joint pain as it is already. anyone with experience? which one to choose?
stelara 5 months with 4800 mg of mesalamine - no symptoms
remsima (remicade). about 95% normal.
just started rinvoq 2.5 months ago after using humira for 2 years and it unfortunately stopped working. rinvoq has me feeling mostly good, especially with being able to control my bowel movements which i feel is most important, but i still have not gained any appetite back after losing it this summer. still much better than no appetite and not being able to hold your bowels!
i've been on 4800mg of mesalamine for 9 months (it's doing nothing) and i'm on my 4th course of pred it 9 months...
humira for about 8 years, and i wouldnâ€™t even know i had uc if not for having to do the shots.
i was on humira for years and 80% feels accurate for me too. i was told to suddenly stop it in november though, and just yesterday my gi decided to move me forward with entyvio, and i'll start that soon pending approval. i've had uc since 2011, and i feel like i've been on every pill under the sun for it before humira.
balsalizide disodium it was the first medication that was prescribed for me along with prednisone to get it to work well iâ€™m off prednisone now and itâ€™s working just fine on its own
currently on mesalamine and mesalamine suppositories. also hydrocortisone enema, prednisone, 6mp and just started humira.
humira and azathioprine
rinvoq. 45mg 8 weeks / 30mg 4 weeks then to 15mg maintain does/ working very well
been on renflexis (infliximab) for 2 years since diagnosis (pancolitis in hospital for 5 weeks).
same here for at least 10 years. occasionally prednisone.
same for me, working 99%
same, working 85% of the time for me
"same here. 4 tablets a day, iâ€™ve been on it for well over a year. 

in november i started to flare again and my gi started me on protofoam and suppositories. 

getting better day by day."
same for me too. think iâ€™m seeing an improvement
i take apriso mesalamine er. can live a normal life again but still got the silly blood shits
im on this too and i am in a really good place with my uc
iâ€™m on the slow release mesalamine granules
same
this gives me hope! just started entyvio but i always hear how people have to switch it after awhile so iâ€™m glad to see someone whoâ€™s been on it for five years
"oh, interesting! iâ€™ve been managing well on mesalamine since diagnosis and just flared after giving birth - iâ€™ve been doing predsol enema for 3 weeks when usually it resolves within 1-2. booked to see my gastro doc on monday but iâ€™m wondering how long you tried prednisone until making the switch to biologic?

(trying to prepare myself for maybe needing change of meds if things donâ€™t settle this week!)"
just yesterday my gi decided to start me on entyvio! i'm looking forward to it, but a little nervous.
how long did it take to work
how is working ?
ðŸ™ƒðŸ™„
how long did that take?
why are you on methotrexate with stelara? curious as i am on stelara and was told did not need it. was previously on remicade and was told would have added it if i weren't pregnant at the time i started remicade
was looking for another xeljanz response. iâ€™ve been on it for the last 4-5 years (started right when it was approved for uc) and itâ€™s been great for me. i get the copay savings from pfizer so itâ€™s been the cheapest option also, which is good because i developed a huge fear of needles after trying humira for about a year.
iâ€™ve been on stelara for 5 months and prednisone. finally seeing major improvement. just tapered off of prednisone so only on stelara, lialda and uceris. how long did it take you to get to 95%? any other meds?
same here - a year in
"do you have a source for your 1%? last information i got is about 10% have a mild liver dysfunction (reversible after stopping the meds). however there is a chance (not totally studied yet), that it can cause pulmonary arterial hypertension (shown in at least one case). the study showing the 10 percent risk for liver problems was stopped at that point for safety reasons.


my [source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/s0016508517363825)"
so when do you use prednisone ? if you have a flare that doesnâ€™t mean the mesalamine failed ? you go back and stay in remission after the prednisone with the same medication ?
how many pred cycles in 10 years? i've done 4 cycles in 3 years. thinking about moving on to biologics
whoa- ten years. have you ever tried to tapper off of it?
"it worked amazing for me, just get fatigue and some joint pain for 1-2 days post infusion. i did switch at one point to every 6 weeks right before and during my second pregnancy but i think it was more stress than uc (covid and covid baby - super fun, and i have ibs so of course my anxiety looks like a uc flare). i was able to go back to 8 week schedule though after a year! just had colonoscopy in the fall and iâ€™m in remission still. we will see how long it lasts but itâ€™s been great. 

i have seen they have a self-injector you can do at home every 2 weeks for entyvio now but i havenâ€™t heard anyone on it and iâ€™d switch but am afraid to change the iv infusion since itâ€™s been working for me. donâ€™t mess with a good thing as they say. 

my only complaint is honestly that my joints hurt so much more on it. but also, again, my ligaments stretched, iâ€™m a bit heavier and my life is so different so hard to compare to being orally meds for me. i do think itâ€™s uc because it worsens with my infusion schedule (just before and just after). but, again, beats the hell out of living life on the bathroom and pooping myself all over town! 

best of luck to you on your journey!!"
"donâ€™t worry about it. if that time comes, it comes, nothing you can do. so just forget about it :)

stress isnâ€™t good for our conditions eitherâ€¦."
"i was on prednisone for about 3 weeks plus budesonide enema. i had zero improvement though on oral prednisone and minimal with the enema. itâ€™s rare to have no change on prednisone at all, so they knew i failed the prednisone dose within a week. they kept me on it and the added the enema until they could do a colonoscopy to assess what was happening and then added biologic as soon as they could since the steroid didnâ€™t help. 

essentially within a week i had no change in symptoms on the prednisone so they said they were going to biologic after the scope. iâ€™m not sure if it would have been different if i had slight or any improvement with the steroid though."
definitely was so sad that i felt i had failed orals and it seemed like such a big switch, but itâ€™s been so much easier actually in daily living not doing pills and itâ€™s a quick 2 hours every 2 months and otherwise just living life - so i definitely hope you have the same luck!
took well over 6, more like 8 months for it to help me
i was on a course of prednisone when i started it which helps me instantly and i never fell back in a flare. so very quickly!
"well for the most part.  
real test is to see how the maintenance dose (30mg) holds up in the next few weeks and months"
i personally noticed that my symptoms went away almost completely within a few weeks of taking 4.8 grams of mesalamine orally and 1,000 mg mesalamine suppositories. i tailored off the suppositories after a few months as i was no longer bleeding and iâ€™ve been in clinical remission for almost 1.5 years at this point.
my doctor would rather i have layers of medication which do a little bit to help, in case stelara fails. my flares go from 0 -100 in a few days and into the severe category. it's not expensive for me, around $50 a month, and i don't have side effects to anything either. i am steroid refactory and i think he is trying to keep me out of hospital.
i returned to my baseline bowel function (constipation & gas) about 9-10 months after i started stelara.  i take a daily dose of metamucil and drink a lot of water.  i still see an occasional smear of blood if i have to strain to go, but otherwise i'm back to normal.  i'm also taking wellbutrin to control my anxiety/adhd and i think that's been a major component.  i had to stop fighting being sick before i could really heal.
"sure thing! this study claims of 49k uc patients taking qing dai 1.2% developed pulmonary hypertensionâ€¦ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s2589790x23001920

when i said â€œrough risksâ€ i was referring to the pht. the liver function stuff was all reversible and what i would consider â€œmildâ€ from my research. like taking tylenol daily or drinking alcohol. a lot of meds process through the liver and can damage it when overused, so i wasnâ€™t as concerned about that. 

i can say i read a number of studies before trying it myself. took half the dose for half the weeks. (1/2 gram daily for 4 weeks instead of 1 gram daily for 8) and went into full remission which has lasted 6 months now after years of symptoms. i now do a single pill once every 2 weeks or so, just in case. i was originally diagnosed with uc in my 20s. later it was changed to a diagnosis of crohns in my 30â€™s. a lot of people hate on it when i post about it, but read the studies and weigh the risks! itâ€™s a poorly understood condition and we are learning everybodyâ€™s body responds differently to things. we arenâ€™t an average. if it works for you, fantastic! if it doesnâ€™t, try something else. iâ€™ve received many messages from others who it worked for, many from people it didnâ€™t, and (because itâ€™s reddit) quite a few calling me an idiot. if you click my profile you can find a few posts i did a while back with more studies and a lot of comments. (disclaimer: iâ€™m not a doctor. iâ€™m an artist. iâ€™m just willing to take calculated and educated risks when the alternative is pooping blood daily or expensive meds that also had side effects and didnâ€™t work well.)"
"i had a horrible postpartum flare after years of remission and started on entyvio in sept. i am
having annoyingly bad joint pain! i am definitely still working on postpartum weight loss, which could contribute to the knee/ankle pain, plus i have a bad sleeper, but iâ€™m realizing that the joint pain might be here to stay. iâ€™m sort so relieved to see another person note this as a side effect because my gi made me feel like it was unusual!"
ah yeah, thatâ€™s what iâ€™m nervous about (steroid taking more than a week), iâ€™ll try to be prepared for a next step. so glad entyvio is working for you!
wow thatâ€™s a long time! i donâ€™t remember it taking that long for me. but it only worked for me for 7 years. iâ€™m now on hadlima. i wish entyvio still worked, itâ€™s the only biologic that is made specifically for our condition.
was it like a gradual process? also weâ€™re you on prednisone?
does prednisone make you gain weight?
thanks for sharing and i wish you the best of luck!
"definitely not unusual. especially since joint pain is also a symptom for some people with uc. i had terrible hip pain during my horrific flare after my first baby. itâ€™s definitely not as bad but feels kind of like restless leg syndrome. like an annoying pain that is just there. walking helps but then after itâ€™s worse lol. exercise definitely helps in general though! i just plan not to do too much the day of and the day after my infusion and i also make sure i have a pillow between my knees to sleep especially for the next couple days bc heaven forbid my knees touch! ouch! i wish i was exercising more because controlled exercise does help but the fatigue of parenthood is as real as the fatigue of chronic disease! 

but also, let me add - comgratulstions!! no one warned me the first baby of postpartum flares being a thing and it was bad! on the up side it was so horrific that i stopped eating anything but oatmeal and bread once a day and some motherâ€™s milk tea with oat milk - just to minimize the amount of bm for my sanity. so the fact i was still pooping but not eating meant i got back to my preparation weight horrifically fast ðŸ™ƒ unfortunately my course of prednisone than gave me moon face so i still had postpartum body issues all the same and felt huge and ugly. looking back now i canâ€™t believe how skinny i was! but also definitely wasnâ€™t a good way to go. eek.

itâ€™s been a while since i went down memory lane here so iâ€™ll stop rambling now ðŸ˜‚

good luck on entyvio and enjoy the baby ðŸ¥°"
"i was very worried about taking the next step for a biologic but itâ€™s almost easier. just once every 2 months get an infusion and relax for 2 hours. donâ€™t have to take 4 horse sized pills ðŸ’Š every day or stress about taking them places or forgetting them.

also, after the entyvio i improved within the week even though usually they say you need to wait loading dose etc - so there is a lot of hope and the meds are improving all the time. definitely a chronic disease and in for the long haul, but thereâ€™s definitely a lot of hope to live a full happy successful life regardless of your status. the only downside is medical cost but entyvio also has a drug program help in case your insurance doesnâ€™t cover it or deductible is huge or you lose insurance - definitely ask gi about that if you need!"
whyâ€™d it stop?
it can. it can make you hungry so you have to be careful youâ€™re not stuffing your face. but it makes some people retain water badly and get a moon face. watching your salt intake can help the water retention. i didnâ€™t gain any weight on it though any of the times iâ€™ve been on it. but iâ€™ve only done 8 week courses, longer ones will of course be more likely to cause weight gain.
ahh soo helpful! thank you on all fronts!! and yes to everything - nobody warned me (my ob says they donâ€™t like to â€œadvertiseâ€ the risk of autoimmune diseases flaring) and i was floored with how bad it was. the first 4 months were rough all around. then the prednisone started and everything just sucked with that too! entyvio has seemed to bring relief so far (fingers crossed), but itâ€™s been an ugly wake up call and reminder that iâ€™m navigating a chronic disease that i essentially forgot about for many, many years. that said, babe is amazing and thank you for the well wishes!!
"this is very reassuring to hear, thank you so much. i actually didnâ€™t know biologics werenâ€™t pills (!), it does sound easier.

the cost side of things can be annoying but i would pay whatever it costs to stay healthy (especially with this new little human iâ€™m responsible for!)."
yes i think most of the biologics (entyvio, humera, remicade) are injectable. so they put the medicine in a bag of saline, place a catheter and run the medication in. there are some that might be pills like azathioprine or methotrexate, but the ones used solely as first line to try for autoimmune uc tend to be the iv injection. :)
good luck! been on for almost a year and feel the best i have in almost 9 years of this disease!
good luck! been on it a few weeks now and feeling good so far. ðŸ¤ž
keep us posted! considering this.
good luck! best one so far in my case!

thanks! how were your side effects? do you have a rough timeline as to when they occurred, assuming you had some? also were you started on the 45mg and then brought down? i'm on the 45 and supposed to be for about 12 weeks. then reassess then. oddly the 12week mark falls on my birthday, so hopefully it's a good present to myself!
thanks!
any side effects? 45mg? if on the 45, how long did they say you'll be on it? 12 weeks and then lower the dose?
will do. 11 hours in, and i'm ok. lol ðŸ˜‚
thanks!
"i did 45 for 8 weeks i think, and then down to 30. i'm back up to 45 because i'm in clinical remission but not endoscopic remission and will be adding skyrizi to the mix, but this is still by far the best i have felt (i've been on all the meds, and this is the only one that has really provided significant relief).

side effects have been mild, but
- headache (easily treated and went away)
- increased hunger (dramtically, but is it just because i was no longer nauseous)
- i got shingles (get the vaccine! my dr told me to and i didn't quickly enough)
- i got covid (i'm all vaxxed and it was very mild, but i was running events and traveling for my job so probably high exposure)

otherwise i have felt really good! it's been a life-changing med for me."
no side effects yet, from what i can tell. and yes, 45 mg for 12 weeks and then switch to the lower dose.
the shingles thing has me a little worried. but i was on remicade for years and humira for like 7 years and thankfully shingles didn't get me. i would think if i was going to get it, wouldn't i have gotten it already?
go for abx464 aa a safer option.  rinvoq will be there if it fails.
literally in the same position as you a few weeks ago. had the choice between the two. pros and cons i found weighed better with going with the rinvoq tbh. side effects wise dk if obefazimod actually has that many less side effects. if you fail rinvoq the closing time for the clinical trial is december so youâ€™ll still probs get on it even if you try rinvoq and fail. big reason for me was having to have three more endoscopies, one of which wouldâ€™ve been like two weeks after my colonoscopy. plus think about how well you would deal with possibly being on a placebo and possibly getting worse and the stress of thinking your on a placebo. they wanted me to stop all meds apart from prednisolone and mesalazine. at the time i donâ€™t think i couldâ€™ve handled it mentally. if you have any side effects on the trial as well youâ€™ll be expected to go into hospital and be checked out every time which could mean a lot more time of work. i was in the same thinking of you to start of with and excited by the idea of a clinical trial but at the end of the day we both have the option to try rinvoq first. drs as well want you to join the trial cos they get paid more for more patients. my care team was surprised i was thinking about the clinical trial when i could just try rinvoq instead which says something as well. overall make your own decision but also think about how it will effect your life in the coming weeks and months regarding hospital trips. induction period for rinvoq is max 16 weeks so would be clear if itâ€™s not working for you before the clinical trial closes as well. funny thing in the contract as well was you had to swear to use a condom whenever you had sex
i think thatâ€™s the best way to see it, even though iâ€™m a bit scared about becoming a clinical tester
wow! thank you so much for sharing this with me. it is so helpful and i did not even fully consider some points you raised. i am still working full time and i did not take into account all the check ups and what to do in case of emergency. may i ask you how you are doing now? any side effects from rinvoq? i am reading a lot about skin conditions.  have you already discussed with your team what be will be the maintenance therapy?
feel like iâ€™m starting to do better with my flare getting better but having some funny things happen in the rest of my body. been having some chest pains, small muscle spasms and fatigue getting worse. but donâ€™t know how much this has to do with the rinvoq vs just being in a flare and not eating properly. having some blood tests done on monday to find out whatâ€™s going on. main thing so far has been a bit of acne on my forehead and nose but apart from that nothing i could say for definite is the rinvoq. for maintenance would be going down to 30mg and then 15 i believe after some time if the 45 mg gets me into remission. but either way whichever option you choose itâ€™ll be the right one for you cos you chose it. would deffo recommend doing your own pros and cons list for both and ask what your family and so think as well. i luckily had a lot of help when making the decision so am happy i could help you with some extra things to think about with your decision. donâ€™t feel rushed into a decision either cos the drs with me were trying to do that with the trial
my doctor is pushing me to do a study where i do dual treatment rinvoq and entyvio. take 10mg twice a day of rinvoq and start entyvio same day. only take rinvoq for 4 weeks to see if it will make entyvio work faster. stop rinvoq stay on entyvio. do you have a guarantee you won't be given the placebo?
indeed it is scary and risky.. but you could also find relief and help the rest of us achieve remission once our current medication fails :p
what did you go for in the end? and howâ€™s it going?
"unfortunately, because of the study, i will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 study treatment group:
â€¢ drug in low doses (25% chance)
â€¢drug in normal dose (50% chance)
â€¢ placebo (25% chance)
neither i nor the study doctor will know which group i am inâ€¦"
oh. that sucks. my doctor guarantees that any study they put me in (my clinic always has multiple studies going on) i will not receive placebo. i am severe with mayo clinic 3 score. i straight up said i wouldn't participate in a study if i couldn't get the med. which makes me wonder how rigged these studies are, at least in us lol.
i was diagnosed when i was 2 n i'm almost 40 now. it's definitely a long n hard road, i've had my fair share of bad times, but my pain is managed very well with zero pain medications (plus i've had surgeries). i can share the regimen of meds i am on if ur interested. but also if u just need to talk to someone that can relate i'm all ears.
"i am sorry that you have suffered so much.

as far as methotrexate goes, have they tried injections instead of pills? the injections were much, much easier on my stomach."
i know it's hard.  it sucks. pep talks suck.  if you need a pity party, have one.  i have had several when i just feel as though i'm a burden.  i wanted to ask though, did your doctor tell you to take folic acid when not taking the meth? (my joke, short for methotrexate.  meth day for me is wednesday.) i am on 5 mg (i think it is) every day except wednesday.  stopped the headaches  and the sore teeth. i know this is a really difficult time, but you are a very strong person. no one with arthritis is weak. we are a creative, inventive bunch who get through stuff with ingenuity and creativity.  hang in there, you'll get back your taste for life.  if not, please seek help. we all need help sometimes.
"with the methotrexate tablets, did you try splitting the dose, so half twice a week? i found that helped my nausea, plus the megafol. i went through a bad flare in my mid 30â€™s and was bedridden for several years, methotrexate was the only thing that helped. this was over 15 years ago, so iâ€™m sure things have changed since then. 

just to give you some hope, things may get better. iâ€™ve been in â€˜almostâ€™ remission (inflammation markers mostly normal, only ferritin is elevated) for over a year now and i have significant periods of time when iâ€™m pain free, compared to pain 100% of the time. i was diagnosed when i was 24 and iâ€™m nearly 50 now."
"you're just like me i got it at kindergarten age, too. and it's terrible. i don't even want to go to school because the pain in my feet are terrible. it's worst if i got 2nd floor class. after i grad from highschool, i started playing dota2 and my pelvic joint get worst and got into accident and bedridden for about 1year and half, i think. and i got to meet a good doctor and get better but the side effect of meds coming to me and got avn and i'm in my bed again for a year and 3 months. my country is suck and i have to wait for my surgery for months. 

i took metho too. 6 pills per week. sometimes metho can give you headache and nausea. what is worst is i have to take 6 of that and other 3 pills. 

don't give up easily. i mean you can do exercise seriously. my regret is that i didn't take seriously after lying on the bed for year and got worse again. i'm so dumb that i forgot that i could go to gym. because of that stupid covid-19.

just don't give up. just think about what is good for you. somethings good will happen to you, just don't give up and stay strong. 

i'm sorry if i write somethings wrong. i'm not fleunt in english and i don't know how to confront other."
"i'm hoping its not practicing mental health professionals telling you it could be worse or everyone has problems. either way, you need to find someone better to talk to. there will be therapists and professionals out there that specialise in patients with chronic pain and seeing one of them could be very valuable. might take a couple of goes to find one that is a good fit for you.

also exploring alternative therapies for chronic pain would be a good idea as already suggested. there's a lot of snake oil out there but also things like cbd etc are still considered alternative.

and stop trying to have the same daily life as normal people. you can't and it won't work. you are going to have to depend on support networks more. that's probably hard to accept to start with because we're all always told everyone needs to make it on their own. also, one of the constants that i see in people who live happier and more fulfilling lives while living with chronic pain is that they do things they find have a very high level of personal reward. i think in a way it counterbalances the higher level of suffering and shitty days. look for it and don't hold back on doing it."
">if i talk to people about it then iâ€™m either told it could always be worse or that everyone has problems

find different people to talk to, the ones you've been bouncing it off of are assholes whether they realize it or not. maybe they'll find themselves disabled in the future and realize how callous that kind of response is.

i'd try to prioritize sleep followed by diet, when it comes to sleep my experience has been less sleep but is high quality is far more productive towards keeping inflammation down versus long durations of low quality sleep... it's all about stage 3 sleep.

if your doctor doesn't understand the importance of sleep in keeping your symptoms in check... find a new doctor."
going through the same thing. 23 now and it started last year in november i took steroids for awhile but all it did was made me gain weight with some relief while taking tordol with it. i keep looking for answers and keep trying to convince myself itâ€™s gonna get better but i canâ€™t even squat, iâ€™ve had to cut my work hours down tremendously, and itâ€™s months before i can i get into a rheumatologist. iâ€™m just trying light stretching and taking tylenol arthritis to get through my days. also iâ€™ve heard biofreeze and naproxen helps a lot. try to keep your head up weâ€™re all here for a reason even if our bodies are telling us to fuck off at the moment itâ€™ll work out eventually.
i was diagnosed at 16/17, and was on methotrexate for a while till the nausea caused me to miss class and felt like crap. i'm currently on humira for my ra and hydroxychloroquine for my iga vasculitis (another autoimmune disease). has your doctor ever brought up using meds like humira? (can't remember the class they are) they are needle or pen injections either once a week or once every 2 weeks.
i recently had a prism test after my rheumatologist's appointment. it's supposed to indicate if tnf inhibitors will work for you or not. for me, it turns out they will not likely work, so i'm getting a jak inhibitor infusion next week. i've been on tnf inhibitors for over 10 years. you should ask about this, it might be the answer for you to get better.
a salve called â€œtraumeelâ€ helps my arthritis a lot.  i hope that it can help some folks.   itâ€™s from europe and itâ€™s made of herbs and salt plants and such. you can get it on amazon and ebay. itâ€™s used by some judo practitioners, thatâ€™s where i heard about it i really like it.
first day in? welcome to h*ll. - rheumatoid arthritis since birth
have you tried any biologics like simponi or humira? iâ€™m fully off methotrexate now that i take this and i have no pain or swelling anymore
my heart goes out to you op, pray for fully automated luxury ai singularity to solve all our problems.
the injections made me constantly nauseous and i threw up after every injection. iâ€™m glad they work for you though :)
i would have folic acid with my meth lol. iâ€™ve been throwing more pity parties than i would like because i just canâ€™t shake away the helpless feelings i have. everyday iâ€™m in pain but itâ€™s to the point where pain is in the back of my mind because iâ€™m so used to it. my joints always feel like they need oiled. itâ€™s just too much sometimes. i donâ€™t see the point in going to therapy because itâ€™s not like anyone can understand unless theyâ€™ve been through it themselves.
itâ€™s really hard but sometimes iâ€™m glad that i got it when i was much younger because if i got it now and my life changed so suddenly i really wouldnâ€™t have been able to handle it at all. do you ever feel like that?
every time my doctor offers me steroids i immediately shut that down because youâ€™re right. when i was on them all that happened was that i gained weight. iâ€™m the same with you not being able to do squats and work is so difficult because if youâ€™re standing youâ€™re sore, if youâ€™re sitting you get sore so thereâ€™s no winning
(humira is a biologic)
i was on humira. iâ€™ve been on quite a few different injections. iâ€™m at the point where i donâ€™t want to take any more medication and iâ€™m happy being depressed and gloomy because itâ€™s all i know at this point haha
oh my god i'm so sorry
i hate to get it at young age but it's good in some way. if i get it at 17 or 18 i too wouldn't have been able to handle it. i'm only 24 and i can still get better and prepare for next time if this get worst again. i can only go to distance uni (you only need to attend for 10days and get into exam, you can get private tution) because of this thing. i hope things will get better and better.
i am curious as to how much prednisone you were prescribed, my experience has been, doctors over prescribe it, gave my dad 40 milligrams. i have found that 2 milligrams one in the morning and one at night keeps me feeling tolerable.
hey, i'd talk to a travel doctor at home or reach out to mobs like the ama here.  vaseline is just on the shelf in chemists and supermarkets.  get in touch with our embassy where ever you are if needed. they'll help you work out the easiest and cheapest way to do this.
"- fagron products are available in australia.
- diprosone is available in australia (turns out i've used it myself some years ago!).
- rinvoq is available in australia.

you'll have to work 3 months of specified work to qualify for a second whv, so why not make a gp appointment during that time, explain your diagnosis and meds (helpful to have a letter from your uk doctor here), and ask for prescriptions. should not be any problems. 

you should be able to get the diprosone on a six-month supply, even."
"i take rinvoq, so that one wouldn't be a problem bringing here.  i travelled with it recently.

 getting new supply would be difficult though as only a rheumatologist or similar specialist can prescribe it and it is then authorised through govt department. 

 it is also very expensive here if you aren't eligible for a rebate. starts at around aud$1200 per month without rebate. would depend on your insurance as to what you would pay."
congratulations! i'm in the us and have been on the trial 2.5 years. my ad is severe and i become very itchy if i skip even one day but i'm glad your strategy works. great way to hack the system ðŸ¤ªupa retails in the us for 65,000usd for one year of the 15mg. not sure what i'm going to do when the study concludes...
you are actually brave for trying / purchasing jak inhibitors internationally. obviously i'm assuming you've done your research but still pretty risky. other than that i'm so glad to hear it worked out for you wishing you and your family good health .would you mind telling me or guiding me on how to purchase jak inhibitors elsewhere because it's expensive in canada. rinvoq jak inhibitors cost $1800 a bottle in  canada without insurance
apart from how wild that story is, i've been on upadacitinib for 6 months. unbelievably life changing. in my wildest dreams, i couldn't imagine the results i've had in such a short amount of time. i can take showers now. like, how normal people have showers.
what made you try this rather than dupixent if i may ask?
are you sure it isn't prednisone tablets?
a system where a medicine can cost that much is a broken system ðŸ˜” at the trial end i'd suggest you order it from bangladesh. it will take some tries, but you can easily find a seller online. hell, with much less than 65k you can even take a trip there and get it yourself ðŸ˜‚
sure, feel free to dm me!
lol i know right!!
do you plan on stopping?
according to what i've read, jak inhibitors seem to be more effective. i'm not a doctor though.
"yes, the tablets are inside the original blisters and packaging, with the production serial number as well. the medicine is so cheap is some countries, that it would be way more expensive to fake it to that precision. if they shipped just the loose tablets, i'd be a lot more wary. 

the chinese guy wasn't even doing it for profit. we weren't able to find a payment method that would work for him for weeks (as usually he only sells in china with alipay), and yet he never messaged me for the money. i had to get back in touch in order to pay him ðŸ˜…"
so true ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
have not discussed that with my derm. i'll be taking it for the foreseeable future.
would u mind sharing ur readings?
just a piece of advice, look into any changes in efficacy after pauses in treatment. you are not supposed to stop taking dupixent because it gives your immune system a chance to react. every time you stop taking it, thereâ€™s a chance it will not work when you take it again. i donâ€™t know if this applies to upadacitinib, but there a similar mechanism, so thereâ€™s definitely a chance.
thanks for the info, i'll look into it!
i'm still on the introductory dose, for about a month now. first two weeks were great, reduced pain and bowel movements, but it's slowly been creeping back to what it was. the pain especially is intense, but i do have several strictures.
did you go down to 15 or 30? if you're trying 15, perhaps it's too low of a dose for you.

im on 30 unfortunately thereâ€™s not really any room for increasing the dose.
dang. i did see a post the other day about someone needing the 45 dose for a little longer than the typical 2 months.
oh i do have a follow up appointment with my consultant in a week, i guess there is no harm in asking.
where did you land with this? i'm seeing that it's common for cd to go 12 weeks at the 45mg dose, whereas uc usually stops around 8. did you go the full 12 at 45mg?
i know what you mean. finally starting mine tomorrow for as and crohns (adalimumab didn't work) wishing you all the best!
good luck!  i did not have any side effects that i noticed with rinvoq.  i have been taking it for crohns since january.  i'm doing really well! hope it works for you as well.
rinvoq has been the best medicine iâ€™ve ever had! humira stopped working for me after under a year. i get annoying pimples on my face but nothing major. iâ€™ve been on it about a year
that's great adalimumab worked for so long for you! it sucks it stopped. i hope you caught it before things got bad. finger crossed indeed! cheers :)
coming up on 2 months for crohnâ€™s. mostly mild side effects like acne and headaches starting out. itâ€™s been pretty effective, have some rough days but overall iâ€™d say itâ€™s working well. some acne still persisting but hoping it subsides when i go down to maintenance dose
iâ€™m so excited for you!! iâ€™ve been taking rinvoq since december after failing allll other treatments since being diagnosed 2013. itâ€™s been the best most consistent results iâ€™ve ever seen and i feel a million times better. best of luck to you ! if you have questions iâ€™m always open to answer.
how are you doing?
night. around 8 or 9
good luck! humira worked for me for 7 or 8 years just recently in like probably 10 months stopped. hence why i'm switching to rinvoq! fingers crossed for us both!
great! thanks!
sounds good! i'm hoping for good results too! humira worked like 7 years for me and stopped working a few months ago.
are you doing a 12 week run on 45mg? and you're 8 weeks into it. how soon did you start getting headaches and acne?
thanks!
"hi, thanks for checking... i posted an update here 

https://reddit.com/r/crohnsdisease/s/mbpgazjvje"
8 weeks on 45 i believe. headaches were only in the first week or so, acne kinda never stopped bc i was on a prednisone taper when i started it. itâ€™s manageable though
alrighty... odd that my plan is 12 weeks on 45. i'd like to drop the dose sooner if i could but i guess i'll see. so far i think i'm ok, it's been in my system for about 11 hours now. might have a slight tinge of discomfort in my forehead, but it feels like nothing and might not be related, lol. sometimes i wish we didn't know about side effects and just had someone tell us, let us know if you feel different, lol. i feel like when we start anticipating something, we start looking for it!
yeah iâ€™m the same way. a bit of a hypochondriac so i always think anything weird i feel is some type of side effect. donâ€™t sweat it, a lot of people have zero side effects
iâ€™m 12 hours in and iâ€™ve got a headache
yea they kinda go away after a while. i've been on it since 9/11.
thanks for the reply. do you take it morning or night? my tummy is rumbling like crazy as i lay here in bed.
what is your question?
"finding a collaboration at reddit is probably not the best idea.

it looks like you are requesting both in vivo and in vitro work. you should either (1) review papers by others in this field and approach them with a proposal for a collaboration project or (2) you should assess the viability of forming a commercial entity and using a cro."
my question is that if anyone could look at my research to verify the findings experimentally.
i have tried first option but finding right people, it has been difficult. the second option is i don't understand could you please break it down into something that i can understand.
well forming a company would require funds i have no mean to generate these kind of funds. also i am not resident of first world country in fact i am resident if yhirld world country so it becomes even more difficult to do option 2.correct me if i am wrong
"if there is the potential for a commercial venture (ie making money off this) you can work towards forming a company, raising money, and then go to a cro to do the work (pay them to do the work).

ultimately your best option is to likely publish in a peer reviewed journal and then work on grants for a collaboration."
then it sounds like there is nothing to do. you can publish and see if someone else picks up your work.
this is the problem, the paper is in the preprint format that was published in chemrxiv which was mistake on my part because i should have published it in bioarxiv where the visibility would be more.still the work that went into this stuff is humangous i had to screen 8000 existing drugs and identify fourteen drugs among them that could work, did simulation, extracted data, interpreted data, documented it and then published it.my main goal is to to validate the findings but this is proving to be more difficult than the research itself.i do not have access to any lab, i have metted out some mails to some professors but no even replied to me.
then that's pretty much it. your best option is to collaborate. you'll need to make introductions. alternatively you can propose to do a phd or postdoc in a lab that would be capable of validating your work and learning to do the work yourself. nothing is going to be done quickly and all options require you to invest your time to get it done.
well road onward seems to be impossible and leading to nowhere.thank you for your time.appreciate your advice.

"generally most colorectal surgeries are laparoscopically done now, so there's seldom need for an open surgery. 

generally most wake-up after surgery feeling amazing, as the large intestine that'd been causing so much pain isn't there anymore. there will be some discomfort as they reduce your pain meds from the surgery. 

you'll want to walk around as soon as you can, and often as you can ask you heal to reduce odds of adverse side effects and improve your outcome. 

a bit of a learning curve on the ostomy and appliance, just get lots of samples of wafers, adhesive and appliances. as they're every stoma is a bit different. 

quality of life is great with a stoma and appliance. it's water tight seal so you can swim with it on. 

most go on to get an internal j-pouch and sit to poop. usually multiple surgeries to get there though."
"itâ€™s a big surgery but as stated above it is laparoscopic. it has been 12 years since my first surgery (2 in total) , has an ostomy for 3 months. 
while quality of life improved, surgery is still tough on the body and i will say inflammation lingers until you learn best protocol and diet for you. one thing that wasnâ€™t mentioned to me is that scar tissue can cause blockages down the road, i donâ€™t say this to deter you but just something to be aware of. good luck!"

aww awesome, thanks so much for taking the time to reply i really appreciate it, i didn't know it was laparoscopic. that's much better news.
there are only 2, maybe 3 jak inhibitors on the market.  rinvoq and xeljanz are pretty similiar as far as how these drugs are designed and how they work.  i take xeljanz and it works well for my arthritis and even cleared up most of my psoriasis.  i have not had any side effects after taking it for a year.  mos tpeople take 10mg a day, i only take 5 and still have very major improvement.  i could not walk before.  i go to the gym daily now.  not 100% pain free but wayyyyy better than before.  i also like it because it has a short half life.  biologics scare me and i have had bad experiences with them.  xeljans is in and out of your system in a few hours.
"you can try another tnf inhibitor (there are plenty) or if your rheum thinks its a tnf class reaction, try something that goes after il-17a or il-23.  there are plenty of options at your point.


or: https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autrev.2021.102902"
i started xeljanz almost 2 weeks ago, which is in the same class. lots of good feedback on here, hoping it works for me! so far my only side effect has been headaches.
just this month xeljanz was given a black warning label.  be prepared for the rest of jaks to follow..  do a lot of research before going this route!
i am on rinvoq, it works really well for me.
thankyou for your reply, i've been on 2 or 3 other biologics with not much improvement. on infliximab i was the best i'd been in years. hoping the funding goes through quickly and i can get started
i have no idea what that means. going to do some googling.
it means the side effect risks are worse than expected, even though they have known for a decade there are issues related to using it.  when i got on it about 7 years ago, it was the best thing since sliced bread....i was told.
">the best thing since sliced bread....i was told

that's what i've been told by my rheumatologist.

what has your experience been if you don't mind me asking? feel free to message if you feel more comfortable"
"its good here, hopefully others might benefit from it.

i've been on everything pretty much for about 30 yrs. everything worked for a bit of time, then quit.  this has been good.  some weird side effects, nothing drastic i dont think.  then again, i am so used to it i probably just ignore things and count them as getting old.

i just spoke with my rheumy and told her i am not going back on xeljanz.  i've been off for 6 weeks due to covid...thats a whole other story!  the best thing ever is prednisone, which i am on, due to covid and having to be off xeljanz. pred is not good to take long term.  i told her i would take those risks over the xeljanz risks, at this time.  we can address it in a month or so.  she was kinda good with that and i need to keep in touch with her.

now listen, your doc knows best but they also should have told you this regarding xeljanz.  i'm 60, in good health,  but this have been wearing on me for 40-45 years.  everyones different, not trying to scare you, it works great.  but for me, i am going a different route.   just do research, thats all.  you have the most powerful tool at your finger tips, the internet.  all these drugs are great but as you have seen recently, its all political and always at the end users expense.

hope this helps some."
could you talk a bit about the concerns with jak inhibitors?
"black warning labels have been added after pfizer \[no surprise\] knowing for over a decade there were serious side effects.  they will follow soon for the other jak inhibitors.  yes, they work well but the side effects, even in the minimal doses make the risk not worth it. 

my rheumatologist admitted that they generally overlook the side effects because it works so well.  that thinking doesnt work for me!"

"adalimumab and secukinumab are not dmards, they are biologics, which are the gold standard treatment for as.  how long were you on them for?

i really wouldn't worry about what could possibly happen, you could be struck by lightning or mown down by a bus, but you don't generally worry about them day to day.  same deal here.  only worry about it if it happens ðŸ‘"
i take rinvoq for my as and honestly i haven't noticed any negative side effects. i did have to get my shingles vaccine.
nothing to add but some good vibes and sympathy. â¤ï¸â€ðŸ©¹  it's a roller coaster ride for sure.
"i was humira for about a decade until its effectiveness had some noticeable declines. so i tried rinvoq, not a big fan of the daily pill. if i accidentally missed a dose and took the next days i would be super nauseous and dizzy for about 24-72 hrs afterwards. 

it's also the first immunosuppressant that i actually developed an infection on besides my general sinus infections. it was not my cup of tea"
i was on rinvoq and only side effect was upset tiny at first. it didnâ€™t work well for me, so now iâ€™m on xeljanz and that is going better!
i took it for 3 months with little benefits and no side effects at all then my rheumatologist changed my my medication to simponi. as any medication it can have side effects, but doesn't mean will have to happen to you, try to follow the doctor recommendations and report anything suspicious, specially any related sling allergy or difficult breathing. stay strong fellow human.
sheâ€™s not wrong to make sure the patient is aware of the potential for serious side effects. rinvoq, unlike many of the as/axspa drugs, has 5 or 6 fda box warnings, which are the most serious warnings for fda-approved drugs. that said, at some point itâ€™s a risk-benefit assessment for the patient and their doctor to make together. i just started it a month ago and have had many of the same worries as op, but the reality is that iâ€™ve tried three other drugs and i either havenâ€™t tolerated them or they didnâ€™t work adequately. since starting rinvoq, iâ€™ve had some significant nausea, but so far iâ€™ve been sleeping more comfortably than at any point in the last few years. the box warnings about cancers, heart disease, blood clots, and intestinal tears are scary, of course, but just be extra aware of what your body is telling you as you get started on the drug.
used to take enbrel and humira and i always got a rash at the injection site when taking them.
please post updates in 5 or 10 years when mice trials have been completed, and maybe 10-20 years when human trials are done ðŸ™„ðŸ¥±
you do realize that bitch angela cristiano has patended this 10 years ago and never studied it again?
what r these used for actually? or is it aimed at hair loss?
when will they hit the markets?
pretty sure there's already a topical jak inhibitor on the market. it would be hard to get your hands on it. i'd smear some along my hairline if i had access to it

several jak inhibitors are on the market. fun fact, the jak inhibitor baricitinib is approved for use in severe covid. and alopecia areata.
i have really bad eczema as well as hair loss, would this pill taken orally address both at the same time? seems worth it even if it would lower my immune system a little.
iâ€™m experiencing hair loss should i try abrocitinib?

sounds like an ideal treatment for you.
i swear i have read about jak inhibitors a few years ago and nothing came from it, i can't remember why though
there were some that failed clinical trial stages as an indication of causing cancer.
oh shit, i see
very helpful list this should be pinned for reference.
"> nicotine

i haven't seen any medical sources actually **recommending** nicotine?"
"if this becomes a reference for this sub, it would be nice to make a distinction between the different ""class"" of biologics and small molecules like:  antitnf (infliximab,  adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, golimumab), anti-integrin (vedolizumab, natalizumab), jak inhibitor (upadacitinib, tofacitinib)...

also, i came across studies or papers that talked about other treatments like etrolizumab, mirikizumab, carotegrast methyl, brepocitinib, ritlecitinib but they seem to still be in phase 3 or even 2, so i am not sure you want to add them.

i was also making a similar list. i also added some information for each treatment like how the treatments work, their efficiency... it's still a work in progress but i made my docs publicly available here (with the possibility to add comments - any contribution is very welcome, as i am still updating it several times per week):  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gs17g08rnhcs0\_h9\_v-ihjjbstjjgxbv-x3g3fagiqi/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gs17g08rnhcs0_h9_v-ihjjbstjjgxbv-x3g3fagiqi/edit?usp=sharing)

"one other thing you're missing (probably because it's not really a thing in the us either) is cytapheresis. it's a treatment used in japan where instead of using medication to blunt the excessive response by your white blood cells, they hook you up to a machine that simply filters white cells out of your blood to remove them and reduces their attack efficacy that way.

"that's cause they don't. all the papers that discovered nicotine as beneficial also noted that the general risk of smoking still outweighs the potential benefit in patients with ibd.

in practice that means doctors won't recommend anyone start smoking, but if you're already smoking and refuse to quit they'll just let it slide."
"thanks for sharing this! this is really useful.   


out of curiosity, did you have any difficulty convincing your gi to let you go back to aza after biologics? i was in stable remission on methotrexate for close to ten years but recently had to switch to entyvio to try and start a family. i've wondered how difficult it would be to go back to methotrexate down the road if entyvio doesn't do the trick for me (assuming we conceive before that time comes).   


i'm also wondering, based on your research, if you feel positive about what's in the pipeline for uc treatments? i get freaked out sometimes thinking about the options being limited, but it seems like the resources you provided suggest there is more on the way."
this article is very good but they donâ€™t mention when we will see the new treatments 2023?
hi, do you have an updated link to the google doc? i'd love to read this.
my doctor said it's a jak inhibitor.
yup, listed in targeted oral small molecules aka jak inhibitors
thank you so much. i know nothing about the possible surgical options
nicotine is listed

nobody recommends smoking but they do recommend patches and enemas.
"i am glad it is useful for you. 

it wasn't me who went back to aza after trying biologics. i copied/pasted a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ulcerativecolitis/comments/vdsb49/comment/icniz80) from u/enroute2 which i found useful. 

concerning the treatment in the pipeline, i really don't know. i was diagnosed less than 2 months ago; i didn't even know that there was such a thing as uc before that. i am only on 5-asa so for me it feels like i still have many, many, options. but i understand that for someone who has already tried many treatments it feels totally differents. i am optimistic because many new discoveries are being made. they are not specifically about uc but about many health aspects from genetics to the immune system (\*). this will lead to the development of new treatment, but i don't know how long it will take. and it may not come in time for us, so in any case, i have already made peace with the idea that i will eventually have to give up my colon (even though it may not happen as i only have mild symptoms and proctitis). but i already know that i don't want to endure years of suffering, just to preserve a piece of myself that is... well, that is trying to kill me. in the worst case that i can't get a j-pouch of something like that, i don't mind having a stoma. the only problem is if i want to make a long trip in a country without good medical care, i will need many bags. but then, thanks to this post, i discovered the ""continent ileostomy"". i only hope that by the time i need it, it will be common. i guess that's not really what you wanted to hear, but the reality is that i don't know much. i only tried to educate myself about the many new paths my life could take and copy/paste anything that sounded useful, just in case. 

(\*) some links that make me optimistic:

i don't know how long phase ii and phase iii last. from the comments in this sub, it seems that some of them (like upadacitinib/rinvoq and tofacitinib/xeljanz) are already available.
its not the nicotine sadly
thanks. i skimmed through it, and it sounds convincing. but itâ€™s frustrating that this was published in 2005, but seemingly nothing has come of it. come on, science. iâ€™m not getting any younger here
who does?
"i really like your attitude about it! thanks for replying, and for the links.   


strangely enough, i've also mostly made my peace with the idea that someday i may need my colon removed. i've read enough versions of ""surgery immediately improved my life, i wish i'd done it sooner"" to appreciate that while not perfect, it's a valid solution. uc sucks and i wouldn't wish it on anybody, but it's also one of the few chronic illnesses that can largely be ""cured"" (using that word loosely) to the extent that it mostly doesn't impact our lives anymore. silver linings haha."
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc7681756/
"same here. the ""surgery immediately improved my life, i wish i'd done it sooner"" really convinced me. what is more difficult though is to decide when this is the right moment to do it. i guess when the time comes, it's tempting to think that i should just give a try to this new biologic: ""it's could be the one"". but i also see some people in this sub who still have a hard time after the surgery. i wonder if choosing surgery earlier could have prevented this (i am not accusing them, i realize that it's a really difficult choice and a big jump in the unknown). if this is true, then the next question is ""how early should i decide to go for surgery to get the least possible side effects after the surgery?"". i still can't find an answer to this question, but in my case, finding the answer can wait a bit.

that's also what i thought: in the world of chronic illnesses, i am one of the luckiest: i have uc and my uc is (still) mild (double serving of luck!)"
that's only patches, and its mostly a call for more research, even it admits "transdermal nicotine treatment resulted in frequent adverse effects leading to non-compliance, but most patients were able to complete therapy. most of the studies expressed that transdermal nicotine patches alone were no better than placebo" and although mentions use alongside other treatments, it isn't certain and cant recommend a dosage regime because it needs more research to see if its basically coincidence.
that's great. i'm not here to debate you about nicotine. i asked for input regarding available treatments, not their efficacy. it's a possible treatment.
mainly posted for anyone else reading that's considering it or taking it at face value rather than reading in the details.
good list. missing filgotinib but that may only be available in the uk so far
"nice. i was looking to make such a list earlier today actually! these are all i found as well, except the nicotine ones. are these actually used?

only thing is subgrouping biologics within same class (adalimumab, certolizumab, infliximab, and golimumab) all target tnf-alpha and when one fails, the entire class is no longer recommended. thatâ€™s at least how it is where i live. if this is not correct then please tell me (iâ€™d love to be wrong). edit: thus is probably more complex and individual and recommendations will vary by policies and doctors.

similar i believe is the case for tofacitinib, upadacitinib, and eventually filgotinib, as they are all jak inhibitors, or azathioprine/mercathioprine. not sure how it works with the other immunomodulators.

lastly, and this is open to everyone; is there a place to find upcoming early or late stage medications under development? either completely new types or new classes of current types?"
not common but iâ€™ve heard of a few people on low-dose naltrexone
looks pretty thorough to me- no idea nicotine could be prescribed.
never heard of nicotine patches?? be careful with those if you arenâ€™t used to nicotine.

anabolic steroids / testosterone
fda rejected it last i read about it
my dr actually said that failing one anti tnf wouldn't eliminate them all.
there is some use of nicotine for inducing remission in mild to moderate uc in combination with asa-5 drugs. one of the first question i got from my gi was if i had recently quit smoking, and in my case i had finally weaned myself off of nicorette and started having symptoms shortly there after.
regarding biologics, do ya'll thing i should modify the list to call out the anti-tnf, anti-integrin, and anti-il-12 & 23 mechanisms specifically?
">naltrexone

well, check that out! good catch mate, thank you!

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc5845217/"
i'm guessing that's off-label, in response to people who have symptoms immediately after quitting smoking.
are there any other things going on towards this front since this paper from 2005? i feel like we would have heard more in 17 years ðŸ‘€
great catch, thank you very much! i've added it. i wonder if its efficacy is limited to pediatrics or would it work with adults as well?
i will look into it, thank you.
really? do you have any links to support that? i've been on testosterone for years (i'm an old man) and i don't think i've noticed a correlation
i suppose it has to do with how the drug fails. just guessing here, but i suppose if you fail because of adas to a specific type you can try another type, but if you fail because of the method of action its probably useless. iâ€™ll ask my gi when next we speak :)
"yep, i was on it for a while. something like 4mg a night, a low dose indeed. i'm not sure if it was *the* medicine to get me in remission but it was one of three i was taking when i went into remission.

edit: the other two meds i was taking it with was azathioprine and sulfasalazine, both of which i still take. haven't had a refill of the ldn for a few months now, gonna ask my doctor about it probably a next month's visit"
oh ok- ty!
"https://www.reddit.com/r/ulcerativecolitis/comments/uufau6/novel_combination_therapy_achieves_87_remission/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

yes the same author (pravda) ran a small study based on his theory and achieved 87% remission rate. i have previously posted about it. 

that paper was from 2019 and i believe the author is about to publish another paper with some further findings and a treatment protocol."
i failed humira in that it didn't work and i got some really bad skin rashes. so i'm kind of afraid to try any other anti tnf and entyvio works for me. but we had discussed remicade because of a fistula and my gi claims it could still work. the skin stuff scares me more than the not working though.
ooo neat. thx
"there might also be a difference due to the delivery method. infliximab is iv infusion whereas humira is sc injection. 

for example; i had great initial response to iv entyvio, but as is recommended here, after two doses, you switch to sc injection entyvio. iâ€™ve had very poor response to this, and just last week went back to iv with great response so far.

question is then if your side effects were caused by the specific medication or by the action method."
my doc feels like the infusions are more effective than injection and thatâ€™s why itâ€™s ok to try remicade after humira failure.
ohhhh that is so useful. i've been itching to switch to entyvio injections when they're available but maybe i shouldn't. i'm in deep remission for 7 years with the infusions.
"well, there are definitely benefits to injections. at home which is fantastic, more stable dosages with more continuous medicine delivery (108 mg every 2 weeks vs 300 mg every 8 weeks + subcutaneous injection deliver medication slowly and evenly over time).

that said, youâ€™ll have to weigh the risk of changing regiments. â€œif it ainâ€™t broke, donâ€™t fix itâ€ comes to mind. but definitely take it up with your gi once injections become available :)"
i really appreciate your insight. i had no idea injections were already approved in other countries. i really hate the infusion center :-(
congrats!  showers and bathing are one of those things i no longer take for granted.
"so very happy for you!

also, a laugh: i follow the ""toddlers"" community on here and as i was doing my morning scroll, i thought your post was a toddlers post. ðŸ˜‚ also a valid life circumstance i'm which a long, warm shower could be elusive."
i would genuinely love to see some before/after pictures
"congratulations!

is the treatment with upadacintinib life-long? i can't begin to imagine how great it must feel. feeling so much hope for upcoming treatments now."
have you noticed any side effects?
"i want to firstly say that i am so happy for that you've found relief!!! 
i used to be the same way as you, and unfortunately... i've started to climb backwards. i've been on dupixent for almost a year now and i think i'm becoming immune!
have you had any side effects with this new drug? 
once again, congrats!!"
so happy for you! i myself still have eczema around my face and scalp but itâ€™s mostly gone away. the bits that havenâ€™t healed yet are the itchiest though and showering makes me feel like iâ€™m bathing in lava. i wish i could take what youâ€™re taking.
hey man, i just started getting eczema on my hands and toes out of nowhere. iâ€™m the first one in my family to get it. do you have any tips on getting rid of it fast in 2 weeks? i need to get rid of it in 2 weeks. and i shouldnâ€™t take warm showers? and just take cold showers and apply lotion on it everyday? how long does it take for the skin to grow back?
awesome! i am excited to hear if this drug gets approved for atopic dermatitis and is widely available. sounds awesome. looks like it got approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis but still pending for atopic dermatitis
"so happy for you that you have some relief!
just a side note; i find that cold showers make a big impact on my eczema (warm water draws the moisture from ones body). yours sounds really bad though so you have probably already tried cold showers. but if not, definitely worth it. all the best"
"iâ€™m on dupixent and have had similar great results. i was chronically infected, and 85% affected. 3 days after my injection, like clock work, i start to feel 95% normal. 

the one thing i hate about dupixent, though, are all of the eye symptoms. do you find this to be an issue on the new trial?"
i am exactly like you. i'm on a 'potent' steroid at the moment (very potent being the highest) and it hasn't reduced my itching yet (though this is only my second day). i hope you get better soon and i hope you can say 'good riddance' to it
just curious which company is doing this trial?
thank you :) i really have a newfound appreciation haha
hahahha
i wish i had some! to be honest, at the time i would refuse to let myself get photographed it was so bad.
thanks! unfortunately not, i have about another year or so on the program so i'm savouring every minute of it. last year was nothing short of hell, but fortunately the rate at which these eczema treatments are coming out means that there will hopefully be an effective alternative.
none whatsoever.
"thank you so much! i'm sorry that you're becoming immune, but fortunately so many of these drugs are being tested and in a few years we'll hopefully have a variety of options. i myself wanted to go on dupixent but it's not available in my country :( 

i've noticed no side effects at all, but i've only been on it for 3 weeks so we'll have to wait and see."
what country are you in? if your condition is severe enough you will definitely qualify.
you need to make an appointment with a doctor.
every person is different and there's no quick solution. for now, try to keep your skin moisturized (ointment is better than cream, cream is better than lotion). don't use soap anywhere it's not needed, only the smelly parts. your skin needs its own oils and moisture. bar soap (my doctor told me to use dove unscented) is better than liquid soap. cut out fragrances and dyes in your products. hot showers will dry out your skin.
a mild steroid, heaps of moisturizer and avoiding hot water should do it. but everyone is different!
yes, i believe it's brand name is rinvoq. they're still trialing it for ad as well as crohns and psoriatic arthritis, but it shouldn't be long before it's approved or ad.
thank! yes you are right, i did find that the colder the better. however the severity had made me *extremely* sensitive to temperatures, and i just could not handle the cold, particularly during winter.
"congrats on your results :) 

i've had no side effects at all. i had heard about the eye symptoms for dupixent and was worried this might happen too, but so far everything seems fine."
good luck to you too. may i ask, how are you applying the steroid?

this is very interesting!
"omg, 3 weeks and you're cleared?? that is amazing!! i am seriously happy for you! 
and it's alright! my doctors and i have agreed that we're going to stop treatment for a little bit of time, i'm hope that my body will lower its guard.
i would definitely recommend dupixent if it does ever become available!! some parts of my skin are even smooth again which is always a plus!"
"the eye symptoms are true as hell, and i thought iâ€™d escape them. 

they are somewhat managed with a prescription antihistamine eye drop. iâ€™d love to not have eye symptoms. 

what country do you live in? it seems that the drug you are on is approved in america for rheumatoid arthritis, but nothing else. i wonder if i could get my doctor to prescribe it off label"
i just use my hands cause my eczema is bad on my hands so i don't really care too much.
thanks for answering, and iâ€™m so happy for you! iâ€™m in a trial myself for pfizerâ€™s abrocitinib . like you my skin begin clearing up in a few weeks. i started last march and it was great until the fall and winter, iâ€™m not sure if it was the weather or if the drug is beginning to lose effectiveness on me. in the winter it for pretty bad but definitely not as bad as before. it certainly sucks when you think you found your miracle treatment.
"1. i have been on this website for nearly 8 years, and have made several posts on this sub already with my other account before it got suspended.

2. i'm sure if i contacted my derm i might be able to acquire some photos. sorry i'm so self-conscious. 

3. yeah i won't really argue with your overall point, but idk how else to prove i'm not a shill. though i could do with the money. 

4. this drug hasn't even been fda approved for ad, how is this a paid advert?"
yes, especially considering the virus. fortunately with upadacitinib ï¼ˆand dupilumab, afaik) it doesn't actually suppress your immune system, but rather the specific response that causes dermatitis.
"that's awesome, good luck! i hope it works out well for you :) 

and to be honest, it literally cleared up in about a week. my knees, shoulders, and parts of my stomach are very lichenified from my constant scratching but there's no more redness or dryness now. scalp took a little more time but shampoo sorted that right out. how long did dupixent take to work for you?"
"i'm in new zealand. we don't have dupixent (or at least it's wildly overpriced and unaffordable) so i jumped at the chance to get upa. 
if you are in the us see if you can get it off label, because it's really changed my life."
well, it's getting warmer now, has your skin improved since winter?
"i started to notice effects around 3 weeks in, and at about 2 months (so 4 dosages) my skin was clear! after another 2 dosages, i noticed my skin was starting to regain its life. 
and thank you so much! i'm really hoping!"
only a bit unfortunately.
someone come get their auntie, sheâ€™s pretending sheâ€™s a dj at this poorly attended corporate mixer.

just came here bc i hated that commercial too and i noticed they changed it with a different voice over where itâ€™s not so â€œitchâ€ and â€œrashâ€ god hearing that sent such annoyance down my spine lol
"yep i said this on an earlier post about the same commercial. if you're just spinning tunes one after another (like she appears to be doing, she's no grandmaster flash), normally the most you do is adjust the volume if necessary to blend into the previous song. i guess there could be cases where you want to tweak the eq but that's it.

i used to dj at a club. i didn't adjust much at all on the board."

i have allergic reactions to common skin and hair products. i have to take 6 claritin a day due to it else i get tiny zits and big rashes on my cheeks
just hormones or diet not necessarily uc
nope, and i wasnâ€™t acne prone prior to my diagnosis either. the only thing related to uc that makes me break out is when iâ€™m on prednisone. that screws me right up.
"no acne here. iâ€™m late twenties and got diagnosed early twenties. 

youâ€™ve had acne since 17? when weâ€™re you diagnosed with uc?"
in my case, not the uc but the prednisone
"i also got acne relatively late. my friends were wondering when i was like 14-15 how i ate junk food all the time and didnâ€™t get break outs. 

my laziness from adhd or whatever caught up with me when i turned 16 cuz i never really washed my face. still donâ€™t, tbh. not great with routines. 

honestly i think my skin would be fine if i washed my face. it only gets bad if my face is oily and unwashed for like 3-5 days."
uc itself wouldnt, but stress and altered body chemistry is a factor, and nutritional deficiency plays a role.  all things we deal with, so by extention, if you are prone to acne it can be worse during a flare.
prednisone and rinvoq are both known to cause acne. but not uc itself.
janus kinase inhibitors (jaki) commonly cause acne, some times referred to as "jakne".
usually if you have one autoimmune disease you usually have another. rosacea type 2 is what i have. it can look like acne. i have a whole treatment regiment to help combat it. a totally pain in the ass
"prednisone has a solid history with causing acne.

i know some people have had infections with ulcerative colitis and the antibiotics they took to treat the gi infection cleared their acne as well. 

i have not spent a lot of time researching this, but i know chinese facial mapping says certain body parts cause acne in specific areas on the face. the forehead is thought to be indicative of a problem with the small intestine. here is a link to a healthline article that explains this school of thought: [https://www.healthline.com/health/face-mapping#chinese-face-mapping](https://www.healthline.com/health/face-mapping#chinese-face-mapping)

colon cleansing can mean a few different things. if you are mentioning it as taking a supplement that is a laxative, that should absolutely be discussed with your gi doctor before trying. if you are referring to colon cleansing as in rinsing the colon, that could be a much safer option. a water enema is a type of medically recognized ""colon cleanse"", and (medicated) enemas are a typical treatment option for uc. here is a webmd article about the ways to do a colon cleanse and possible benefits/risks: [https://www.webmd.com/balance/natural-colon-cleansing-is-it-necessary](https://www.webmd.com/balance/natural-colon-cleansing-is-it-necessary)

as always, i am not a doctor, and please check multiple sources and preferably your doctor before making impactful health decisions. i wish you good luck and good health! <3"
in my case it's more like rosacea, mostly on cheeks and nose. the only thing that helps is prednisone - all gone after two days of taking it. then it comes back as i'm off of prednisone.
steroids will def make you break out. three days before coming off roids my face broke out so bad
"itâ€™s from the immunosuppressive medications. acne is a bacterial infection so it makes sense. 

for a short period, i was on rinvoq, zeposia, mesalamine, and tapering on steroids all at once and i got covid, staph, and a ringworm infection all at onceâ€¦ this was like a month ago and my body is still bent out of shape from the antibiotics and the tapering off all but rinvoq."
i personally think so because when my flares are bad i get more acne and when my flares go away so does my acne and my skin clears up. probably related to the gut microbiome in some way.
rinvoq has caused me to break out often and iâ€™m not prone to acne at all. itâ€™s definitely done some weird stuff to my skin.
i also take mesalamin and occasionally budenoside (cortisone). but idk i always had the acne and iâ€™m not that often sick haha
oh iâ€™m so sry
"i am so sorry to hear that. those are very severe dermatological conditions. do you have a dermatologist that is helping with this? i found an article form the dermatology times that seems worth a look, as it describes the importance of treatments that take both conditions into account. [https://www.dermatologytimes.com/view/study-finds-hs-associated-with-acne-conglobata](https://www.dermatologytimes.com/view/study-finds-hs-associated-with-acne-conglobata)

i hope you are able to access care and find some relief! <3

edit: i ran into this just a few minutes later and wanted to add that there are some associations between uc/crohn's and shingles. i have found one article that is from a source i like, and there are quite a few more that appeared in google that are from credible sources, but i do not know what those say.

this is the one i ran across that made me come back here: [https://www.everydayhealth.com/crohns-disease/link-between-crohns-disease-shingles/](https://www.everydayhealth.com/crohns-disease/link-between-crohns-disease-shingles/)"
when i was 20 but i always had issues idk.
all jakis can cause acne, tofa-, filgo- and upadacitinib.
that sounds terrible! iâ€™m sorry that happened.
"a lot of acne is caused by bacteria like you said. benzoyl peroxide products treat bacterial acne pretty well. however, if regular acne products arenâ€™t working at all, it is probably a less common type of acne or infection. 

i went to my derm when nothing would get rid of my acne. 
she told me i actually had a microbiome imbalance on my scalp that was causing my fungal acne on my face, so ketoconazole shampoo used on the head cleared my face. my face cleared up 95% in just a couple weeks.  it also god rid of body acne when i started using it as body wash."
"budesonide gave it to me like crazy. i had pimples all on my ear lobes it was nuts, i also gained like 20-30 lbs on it.

but i was very sick and it was worth it. iâ€™m a weirdo and i enjoyed the earlobe pops, they didnâ€™t hurt and werenâ€™t conspicuous and i got awesome pops"
yes i see a dermatologist regularly, use a external solution, external liquid and take doxycycline
well the thing about uc is that almost every symptom and any other variable you can think of associated with this disease is completely different from person to person. so i canâ€™t say for certain that your uc is not a cause. but i can say that your acne, which is a skin related issue, is more associated with the food your eating, the type of exercise you do, and the overall manner in which you care for your skin.
iâ€™m glad you have a derm and treatments! have those helped you? and do you have to be on the antibiotic long term? have they mentioned if youâ€™ll have to switch to a different antibiotic group eventually?
"i donâ€™t know about op, but food and exercise is definitely not what caused my acne. it was purely hormonal. it was also genetic.

i tried eating very clean. i tried exercising regularly for years and then later not exercising at all except walking. i used every skin product my dermatologist recommended. acne remained. 

some people also have fungal acne. so there can be other causes besides diet and exercise, and these things, like hormones and genetics. are often not in our control. itâ€™s not fun."
"hi, this happened to me on xeljanz, which is in the same class as rinvoq. the solution, for me at least, is a low dose statin. diet change doesn't help because the mechanism for the rise in cholesterol isn't diet linked. 

it's a known issue for xeljanz, which is why they monitor it, but it has stabilised really well on statin and my gi isn't concerned."
my last physical was four months after going on rinvoq. and sure enough, my cholesterol was high, after being borderline for years. my blood pressure really jumped, too. so now i'm on medications for both conditions, hoping to get my numbers lower.
this is kind of what i thought would happen. thanks for sharing.
you sound like you're in my exact situation.
my husband says that soon i'll be taking so many medications i won't have to eat! as someone with uc, i'd be okay with not having to eat. :)
as topical it can work. as oral intake it's not worth it, even if we get our hair back, it will lead to other issues, but topical is very exciting? how long till we get our hands in any of those jak inhibitors?
how does this theory address the obvious sensitivity to dht by said hair follicles?
[deleted]
jak inhibitors have nothing to do with male pattern baldness. as a rule, this is focal alopecia. if you have alopecia areata + aga, by inhibiting jak you will get back the hair you lost due to alopecia areata, but your horseshoe will not change.
highly doubt itâ€™s the dht alone that causes the issue and rather the tgf-b proteins that are associated with dht and cause inflammation and eventually fibrosis
more analysis, data and analysis to be available soon
"donâ€™t be pedantic. having a theory is simply taking the information available, and having some level of faith in it. 

everyone has a theory about everythingâ€”doesnâ€™t mean you had to originate it."
"i'll present my pharmacology msc as an indicator of at least 'advanced' knowledge and experience. i firmly believe from review of the pharmacology, the downstream impact on cytokine receptors, the undeniable link to auto-immune inflammatory responses and possible secondary action of slowing hair follicle aging makes it a prime novel approach well worth digging into.

remember, antidepressants (maoi's) were found by accident when trying to treat tuberculosis;

""maois have an interesting history. they were discovered by physicians at sea view hospital on staten island, who were testing drugs for tuberculosis in the 1950s. besides fresh air and rest, there was little doctors could do at the time to treat tuberculosis. the two drugs they tested were isoniazid and iproniazid. one of the doctors noted that patients who took iproniazid had greater vitality, participated more in social activities and expressed a desire to leave the hospital and go home despite the fact they were dying.""

maybe the cure of mpb lies in a seborrheic dermatitis treatmente skin disorder called lamellar ichthyosis.

maybe the cure of mpb lies in a seborrheic dermatitis treatment skin disorder called lamellar ichthyosis."
this has yet to be tested, investigated or proven so you are in no position to make this statement. i used the word 'theory', which should have made it clear this would need to be properly and scientifically investigated and tested.
i am not suggesting its dht alone. just asking how this theory incorporates the dht impact, if at all.
is this near to being marketed?  it.seems like they have been testing this for years?
"it's already proven, i know what i'm talking about. here's what it actually looks like:  


https://www.hairlosstalk.com/interact/attachments/man-with-alopecia-totalis-regrows-hair-finds-he-has-receding-hairline-jpg.181427/"
oh yeah that makes sense. i think blocking the inflammatory pathway is the key tho, and blocking dht also blocks the tgfb-1 inflammatory response. people have had really good results using betacap which is a beta blocker. the problem is itâ€™s a topical steroid which is terrible for long term use. i think there could be a lot of promise in beta blocking, without surprising dht.
i wish they would ban advertising of this shit like they did with cigarettes. but i suppose big pharma says we canâ€™t.
astra zeneca may be able to help
every commercial break now features at least one pharmaceutical commercial. itâ€™s really disgusting
yeah, it's out of control.
how about use that tucking money to make your products affordable so insurance doesnâ€™t eat up everyoneâ€™s savings. goddamn crooks.
no way of it becoming illegal when both major parties pockets are lined with pharmabucks. that being said these commecials piss me off than any grubhub or stache amazon commercial.
sd be illegal...
learn how abbvie can help you save!!
i watch a lot of jeopardy and the commercial breaks are terrifying
"my hatred of pharma commercials is what brought me here.  on the bright side, i stopped having the tv on while eating, the ubiquitous disclosures warning of â€œnausea vomiting and deathâ€ every five minutes was not conducive for an enjoyable meal.  
 
i may be wrong, but these commercials are not legal in most of the world, except the us and finland (or is it iceland?).  arenâ€™t we the lucky ones . (eyes rolling)."
prescription drug commercials are my favoriteâ€¦ the fake lives the actors have in them are funny to me
many of these drugs are killers or have very serious side effects.
pharmaceutical reps are unemployed now???
this is a lot of useful info and answers several things i've wandered about but didn't want to look up. i didn't realize pharmaceutical reps were no longer needed though. even though most of these drugs are more dangerous than tobacco, the ads will never be illegal. they will just keep getting more frequent and longer, while the cost of these shitty ads is passed on to the poor people that suffer these illnesses. that money should be used for research or to help people afford medication/treatment.
i used to get that annoying ear ringing. but then i took adrenocetomenodrenolcocylphol and now i'm dancing for some reason.
i am so sick of these damn pharma ads.
iâ€™ve seen ones a lot lately for a condition that seems probably rare (cirrhosis related neurological conditions, i think?) and wonder why theyâ€™re spending so much money for what has to be a very small pool of potential patients/customers.
"go far with fartella! 

 *(fartella is not for everyone.  side effects of fartella include increased flatulence, gastric discomfort, excessive flatulence, medical bankruptcy, excessively increased flatulence and in rare cases can cause a condition known as jet propulsion syndrome. fartella should not be given to children under 12 or adults over 18, and has not been tested on adolescents between 12 and 17. we canâ€™t get them past the name. while on fartella, patients should avoid proximity to open flames. in clinical trials someone tried to light a fartella patientâ€™s flatus. hugeconglom pharmaceutical denies all responsibility for the resulting city-block-size crater, now a superfund site.)* 

fartella! ask your doctor today!"
kind of like when they used to give out packs of cigarettes at drs offices. seeing a similarity?
what gets me are the 'side effects' that they rush through while happy music plays.  you know, 'events' like blood clots, strokes, heart attacks, trouble breathing, sudden seizures, pml, cancers, and - mentioned as if just another 'event' - death!
i just spit out my drink! ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
shingles doesn't careðŸ˜„
ðŸ˜„ðŸ’€
common side effect of many prescription drugs
or as i love to joke with: shingles doesn't give a fuck.
check, check, and check!!!
"i can't speak to how it works leaving from in germany, or any restrictions south america might have. however, i will say that when i visited your lovely country from the us, i was able to take 3 months of meds with me. i had to call my doctor and explain the situation, but they were able to write me a prescription that covered my time out of the country. i'd imagine you may be able to do something similar. though some countries do seem to only allow a 3 month maximum, which could be problematic. 


**it's best to directly contact the embassy of any place you are traveling to or traveling through.**

from us to germany (and through some surrounding countries), it only took a bit of extra paperwork to document the prescription from my doctor (and i had to keep the pills in the original bottles in my carry-on, of course) was all that was necessary. 

i also kept a copy of the paperwork back in the us with a friend, so they could send it to me just in case."
hey, i'm in the middle of this now - in southeast asia after 6 months in central and south america. i'm on methotrexate so advice is specific to that but i'm happy to chat, i even wrote a blog recently on the planning stages of the trip which i'm happy to share with you if helpful. the tldr is it's complicated but doable, i've had a great time
"contacting the embassy is a great idea! since i will be on the road for a while i canâ€™t take all of my supplies with me because i canâ€™t get a prescription for that amount and as far as i know rinvoq is not available where i go. so maybe it is possible to send it to an embassy. 
thank you!"
wow yeah iâ€˜d love to read your blog! and if i have further questions i will definitely dm you if thats fine. thanks a lot in advance!
"and, what did i miss??? zip-liner....... ? the happiest and freest people on earth! dvred a 2 hour program, saw their mix of commercials 4x.

\-oh, and do not forget, if you are allergic to rinvoq, do not take rinvoq."
the dj woman is the one i detest the most!!!!  she acts as if she is performing brain surgery with her look of  fake concentration.  her bobbing up and down dance is pathetic, the dance that is now seen in practically every commercial on tv today.   i wonder why the producers of these ads wants us to hate them so much?
most likely something that this medication treats. your lucky youâ€™re perfectly healthy.
probably a jak like upadacitinib.
yeah definitely a jak inhibitor: upadacitinib, tofacitinib  or filgotinib. i failed mezavant, adalimumab, azathioprine, and vedolizumab. then got a year of remission on tofacitinib before it failed and currently having good success on upadacitinib for last few months (worked for me within days).
there are plenty of other biologic treatments, for example golimulab and infliximab
"this - i suspect a jak inhibitor will be their next attempt if they donâ€™t try infliximab (surprised they havenâ€™t tried that already and went straight to ustekinumab, but might be because of infliximabâ€™s similarity to adalimumab).

good luck, hope you feel better very soon!"
"thanks, glad you're doing well on your new meds! 
do you happen to know what the next step would be if jak inhibitors fail?"
the are both anti tnf i.e. work in the same way as adalimumab so i was told they were unlikely to be good option for me since adalimumab did nothing for me. did you find they did work even after another anti tnf one had failed?
"yeah my consultant said that they wouldn't bother with infliximab since adalimumab failed. 

thanks!"
i haven't tried ustekinumab so that's my last shot currently but hopefully upadacitinib works for a while longer too. my consultant was actually quite reassuring last time i saw him that there are new drugs coming out all the time and there's always surgery too which gives a lot of people their life back.
i was told the same thing so i'm also curious
yep, the ones like rinvoq or tofacitinib are not anti tnf-a
they aren't biologicals, they are jak inhibitors
you're very unpleasant my friend, i was going to give you a list of like 6 other options, but a i can see you already know everything and have bad attitude, so good luck with it
i was just genuinely interested if you'd had success with different anti tnfs when one had failed. how is that being unpleasant:-s because i corrected the two you named that aren't the same class of drugs (and aren't even biologicals)? i've already failed most of the options but was told we wouldn't try other anti tnfs since adalimumab failed so that's why i was interested in your experiences just.

iâ€™m on this research study currently. dr was saying it should be approved by june 1. iâ€™ve been on it for 4 years at various dosages. it got me into remission and iâ€™m currently on a 15mg dose. dr want to take me out because he wants to be able to increase the dose due to the last colonoscopy showing some ulcers. i canâ€™t wait to not be responsible for filling out the stupid diary on a daily basis. oral medication is a nice change.
"i'm excited about this. i also recently was sitting with someone at a lunch who is a pharmacy rep -- she was saying that they got a surprise approval from the fda about cosentyx for hs treatment, as well as alternate delivery systems for treating arthritis. it sounded like she expected it to take another year. 

so i'm just excited to see the fda moving on some things that will improve a lot of peoples' quality of life!"
awesome, another option for when i eventually fail another biologic.
iâ€™m in the uk and started this drug almost 4 weeks ago! iâ€™ve seen great improvement in my health already:â€™) humira (after 8 years of working), infliximab and stelera failed me so this is something positive! if anyone has any questions feel free to ask
this is so exciting! my son just got approval to start it as a pediatric patient but took a bit of time.
"brothers and sisters, this is a huge win for us. for those with questions about this medication:

- it isn't a biologic.
- generics can be made of it.
- should be way more affordable then biologics.
- it works by basically stopping inflammation creating molecules from being able to activate."
awesome would these pills be cheap and approved by insurance? iâ€™m paying too much for remicade cause my insurance wonâ€™t cover it.
my rheumatologist put me on this (via samples) 3-4 weeks ago for my rheumatoid arthritis and my gastroenterologist agreed to it for my crohn's. i've seen no improvement at all in either disease. i've had zero side effects but i'll stay on it for 6 weeks before both drs agree to go back to remicade.
any idea if this could be indicated for crohn's related arthritis as well? i have jia and crohn's, and just failed remicade after almost 8 years of success... it's back to the drawing board now.
thanks for sharing!
rinvoq worked for about 5 months for me (just like every other drug iâ€™ve tried). it no longer is effective for me.
so do you have to fail on drugs like remicade to be eligible for this drug? other than the plain out easiness of it being used compared to a infusion, does it also have less severe side affects that go along with drugs like remicade?
you are one drug ahead of me, slowly losing stelara effectiveness. this is good to hear.
oh iâ€™m in the uk waiting to start this. they told me that itâ€™s not officially licensed until mid june and they are having a special funding request meeting to ask if i can start it early. perhaps it varies slightly by hosptial/ country in the uk.  iâ€™m glad to hear you noticed an improvement quickly!

pretty sure it is still a biologic, according to drugs.com. itâ€™s just a jak inhibitor in pill form. i wish you didnâ€™t have to fail another drug to try it though
you have to pay for remicade? i think j&j does a free medication sheet that you can sign up for. i mean the infusions are like $20k per. how could anyone possibly afford them without assistance?
thatâ€™s such a shame itâ€™s not done anything for you :( been on it for 4 weeks and so far itâ€™s done a lot for me. aside from remicade what other biologics have u tried ?
i think the side effects are supposed to be a lot less? at least thatâ€™s what my doctor told me. iâ€™ve been on it for four weeks and have really loved what itâ€™s done for me so far.
i failed remicade humira 6mp stelara. entyvio worked well but after 3 years it was no longer effective.the criteria to be considered into a drug trial are basically that every approved medication failed or is no longer working. i was on a stem cell study once that worked well for me also for 3 years. they never approved the medicine though and i havenâ€™t had it since.
yeah i had a reaction to infliximab during infusion and i got taken off of stelara after only 8 weeks, didnâ€™t get anything from either of them which is frustrating. i feel like rivoq is the drug for me and hopefully it is for you too
oh interesting! iâ€™m in edinburgh but youâ€™re probably right. it was given to me as an option when stelara failed me. my doctor gave me like 4 options for treatment and suggested rivoq which i knew nothing about at the time. he didnâ€™t explain much about it other than it was a pill you take daily and a few of the side effects. iâ€™m only now after seeing everyone talk about it realising just how new and cool it is!
the fda is doing that for a reason. tnf-as are definitely safer than rinvoq. iâ€™m super excited about rinvoq being approved but it makes sense to have people fail safer drugs before moving to rinvoq.
xeljanz, humira, mp something
ah ok iâ€™m in england so it would track that its slightly different in different countries within the uk. i know when i first looked it up a few weeks ago there was hardly any discussion on it but now there seems to be loads.
oh i didnâ€™t know they were safer
yeah same, i feel very lucky now for being able to start it so soon after seeing all the discussions about it, given how casually my doctor talked about it i sort of just assumed it was being used all around the uk. i really hope you donâ€™t have any issues and can start it asap, iâ€™m really loving the results iâ€™m feeling so far.

he eats his sandwich because that's how you eat on rinvoq
all rx commercials should be banned like most other countries do.
you donâ€™t like that bullshit serious electronic music in the background? canâ€™t say i blame youâ€¦ maybe that was their other ad? either way, they should all go to hell
this rivoq ad features a master class in bad acting from the beardo near the end of the commercial. he macks on his sandwich like he's doing porn, and then displays heroic maximum method acting while doing open mouth glee over some remark made at the table. alas, there is no clio award for his dynamic acting chops. he is sad about this.
i fucking hate these commercials
still better than cabenuba. i wonder if everyone in my city but me has hiv when i see the cabenuba ad 13 times during one show.
lolâ€¦which one? rinvoq for ulcerative colitis or rinvoq for eczema? ðŸ˜³ scary how theyâ€™re pimping out the same medication with death and leukaemia as side effectsâ€¦for two very different illnesses.
do not pass go. do not collect $200.
"wait! please donâ€™t call for any more bans on rx ads.  

why???

i love reading these posts.  itsâ€™s a perfect marriage of obnoxious commercials and entertaining posts on r/adsihate."
who is this handsome, tall drink of water in this rinvoq commercial?  great smile; friendly energy.  and that beard.  killer.
yeah, the one with that chick dj is so fucking cringe
"immunosuppressants can impact different parts of your immune system. this can help control your autoimmune issues but also make you vulnerable to infection. the drugs rarely just target the part of our immune system that is off. 

whenever i start new drugs my doctor gives me pamphlets and my pharmacist and drug company have been great resource to learn more. i would ask those resources.

happy to hear you are feeling great, and glad you are listening to medical advice about testing and isolation when your wbc is low."
what medication is it? most immunosuppressants used for ibd (but not all) suppress only specific parts of the immune system.
itâ€™s not necessarily a surprise but more like a â€œuh oh weâ€™ve over shotâ€ kind of thing. thatâ€™s basically it sadly. sometimes we might just need to taper the dose a bit more. we want the balance of a calmer immune system, but still strong enough to fight infections.
do you know if itâ€™s dangerous to start immunosuppressants if my wbc has been low for the last 5 yrs or so? (there was one time when the rbc switched to being low and white in range but other than that always wbc low).
rinvoq/upadacitinib
gotchaâ€”the reaction seemed pretty strong and intense from the department nurses, so this is helpful to learn!
you need to ask your primary care and specialist doctor. sometimes the risk for infection is worth the reduced risk of having a bad ibd flare. rbc can be related to internal bleeding or nutritional deficiencies.

likely interdigital intertrigo. working to keep the interspace dry and getting rid of microbial overgrowth is the goal. soaking the foot for 15 minutes in a dilute chlorhexidine (hibiclens) solution will kill most organisms. topical antimicrobial agents such as miconazole or clotrimazole after complete drying can help as well. spending as much time shoeless as possible and separating toes with moleskin can also help.
i live in australia as well, a co worker suggested it might be a spider bite
">Â topical antimicrobial agents such as miconazole or clotrimazoleÂ 

i recommend these in powder forms"
to stop all the awful things that have happened with not enough trials in the past. it absolutely sucks, but nobody wants another thalidomide.
this is heartbreaking, to have that normal life then to have it taken away when it would be so simple to continue. i'm sorry. if it gets approves earlier for other illnesses maybe there is a chance of a doctor prescribing it for off label use?
"i was in the trial for 21 months, the only side effect i and just a few other patients at the hospital that ran my trial was occasional mild acne.   they have 4000 patients in the phase 3 data for ra.  why do they require 15 to 18 months to analyze it ?

moreover, if i want to take the risk of using the med before approval, why shouldn't that be a patient's right ? if i absolve everybody of any liability and its my risk, what is the problem.   honestly, when you have severe eczema, the idea of being dead doesn't seem like a horrible option to living in eczema hell."
yes, but the fda takes so long to approve, 15 to 18 months is just outrageously long time to wait for the arthritis approval., at which point it can be prescribed off label.
"itâ€™s almost impossible to ever absolve any kind of risk in that way, legally, as far as i know. it requires that long because there are so many safeguards and committees and a lot of paperwork and checks. they have to come up with prescribing guidelines and pathways and educate medical professionals about how to use it best. they canâ€™t be thinking about individuals, they have to think of the overall risk to the whole population, which is a huge responsibility. plus, if anything goes bad, they will lose millions of dollars by losing business. 

it sucks but this is the *best* system we have had so far, to avoid danger."

i am currently waiting on my results for a stelara antibody test, i'm in the same boat.
i have such a similar story to you! i tried humira first and it worked for about a year and half and then i changed my diet and ended in a flare. upped to weekly humira and was told it stopped working and in fact my crohnâ€™s had worsened. been on stelara for the past year but it hasnâ€™t really done anything. i donâ€™t know whatâ€™s next, iâ€™m really acne prone and i donâ€™t want to get it again from rinvoq so iâ€™m so scared to try it! but donâ€™t know what others are even worth trying, really donâ€™t want infusions either ðŸ˜©
how long have you been on it?
hey iâ€™m literally in this situation currentlyâ€¦ what did you end up doing?
bout 2 weeks now.
hey! iâ€™m now on entviyo iâ€™ve had 2 infusions so far and will be moving onto self injections soon. they basically said donâ€™t bother with rinvoq as a female because it can cause infertilityâ€¦
how are you liking it?
"i have no major complaints yet. it was kind of a pain getting the copay card setup, but that seems to be an issue specifically with my insurance plan over something wrong with the meds themselves. stuff is tasteless, so no pred aftertaste nastiness, medium sized pill, so nothing whacky there, and in the 2 weeks i've been on it has already nuked my symptoms by like 80% across the board. so far, i'm quite pleased with it, i'm mostly just trying to take getting into shape much more seriously after warnings about heart issues when you are older on it.   


honestly i'm just still kind of in shock i can treat it with just a pill again, hasn't really completely registered in my lizard brain :d"

this is a nonspecific appearance that could be hundreds of conditions. it is not likely to be worrisome. btw, upadacitinib is not a biologic.
just fyi, i got a confirmed diagnosis that it is in fact shingles ðŸ˜”
sorry iâ€™ve been on a few biologics now so i just call them that when referring to drugs used to target my crohnâ€™s!
got it. i suspect the appearance changed.
no much the same, i guess with how it looks and my other symptoms itâ€™s quite clear that itâ€™s shingles
since she has tolerated humira, what do you think of golimumab ( simponi) ?
are there other meds she has tried that aren't included on the allergy list you shared?
"idk can high dose conrtico steroids help at this stage or not cause most of dmards shes intolerant to, otherwise she has to endure the symptoms of them if possible     
edit: now that she refuses steroid she either has to take them or simply be put down"
if it works its good then but most of become useless by time cause body develops anti bodies against them
"sheâ€™s on metformin and lisinopril

she has tried adalimumab ( therapeutic failure) and sheâ€™s refusing steroids"
yes it indeed helps with itching
jak inhibitors might be even better than dupixent for itching done it also inhibits il31
"rinvoq is already approved for arthritis and may be prescribed off label for eczema, as upadacitinib is very deep in phase 3 studies with excellent data for eczema.  it is incredibly effective in reducing pruritis.

source: i was a patient in the phase 2 study for upadacitinib"

"i was never admitted. but got close - had to attend day clinic everday for a week.

&#x200b;

working real hard on skin at moment.

probably at 30% coverage, but fight back"
if you dont mind me asking. what are some of the ingredients of the emollient and moisturizers they gave you?
iâ€™m so sorry for you, that must have been awful, just out of curiosity have you ever tried or been prescribed dupixent?
"i had 80,% too.. back in the 90s... all they gave me was doak oil baths that made me stink and tons of hug tubs of cotizone creams.....

diet change and what soaps i use for cleaning my body and laundry also helped so much."
"hey, i wanna ask. i'm currently having full-body eczema and i wanna know how you got admitted for inpatient treatment? do you have to go to the dermatologist and get a recommendation first or can you go straight to the hospital?

also, was it particularly expensive? or did your insurance cover it?"
[deleted]
thank you <3
ouch! best of luck!
"it was basically all just paraffin, iirc. they added this mixture to the bath that would slowly solidify as the water cooled, so small bits of paraffin wax began to appear that you could pick up and rub in. it felt amazing! the emollient i used after the wet wrap was called 50/50 ointment, which is literally nothing but a mixture of white soft paraffin and liquid paraffin. it was extremely greasy and could make a mess but was absolutely remarkable for sealing in moisture.

the regular moisturizer is sorbolene."
please do give dupixent a try, it changed my life
i would give anything in the world to try dupixent, but as far as i know they don't have it where i am :( or at the very least it's impossibly expensive. i've heard such great things. hopefully this upadacitinib will be very similar.
what kind of diet change? personally i haven't noticed diet affecting my skin very much, if at all. except i have found certain greasy foods can make me flare up, but that's about it. i do wonder what else might be affecting it that i haven't try cutting out / adding in yet.
"yes, i had to see the dermotologist. i was told by my gp that this guy is particularly good so i had to wait like a month before i could see him (at which point it got so bad i literally couldn't bend over and could hardly use my arms). i don't have insurance so i had to pay like 300 bucks for the derm, but he referred me straight to hospital. the treatment there was free though. if i'd just gone straight to the hospital they might've just sent me home so i absolutely needed the referral.
if your full body eczema is bad enough that home treatment is not an option then you would get referred. they only keep you in until you're at a point where self care is possible.

edit: the treatment itself is just a whole lot of steroid creams and moisturizers. it's barely even a short term fix"
you're only really sent in for inpatient treatment if self care won't work. when i went in to the dermatologist he straight up told me that home care won't fix it as i was sub-erythrodermic. i couldn't bend over and could hardly use my arms. in fact, all my joints (hips included) were so inflamed that it was a miracle i was able to walk to the hospital. my stay was simply to get me back to a level where i could sustain myself until i could try a new medication, so unless your kid is not responding to current treatments at all then probably won't be referred. it's literally a last resort, if that makes sense.
cool thx!
"i gave up gluten and dairy and meat. that did a big difference. sugar too!!
do you smoke? i know smoke makes my ezcmea crazy.  same for animal dandur"
[deleted]
"i'm vegetarian and i hardly eat dairy. i did try gluten free for several month but it made no difference whatsoever. sugar sometimes does make me flare, but going without i still get flares so i don't even know. 
i do smoke but definitely not as much as i used to, and even then i still get massive flares. 
i'm allergic to cats but weirdly enough they don't affect my skin."
i'm really sorry to hear that, especially because i've heard good things about methotrexate. have you guys tried cyclosporine?

"each person is going to react differently to medication, so take everything i say with a grain of salt. also, 35f and in the us.

i'm currently on skyrizi with minimal side effects. maybe a little fatigue after the injection? but minimal. i can go to work the next day no problem. i had more fatigue and mild headaches with stelara, but those would usually go away with a nap and acetaminophen. but stelara never worked well enough for me, which is why i switched to skyrizi. they work somewhat similarly, but head to head studies have shown that skyrizi is more effective.

i have not been on inflixamab, but that is what my sister is on. it generally works faster the skyrizi or stelara, which is good if you're flaring. she does experience fatigue after her infusions. she gets them on friday afternoons so she can rest over the weekend. but it isn't constant fatigue."
thanks so much for your reply! itâ€™s such a minefield out there ðŸ˜¹ i spoke with my doctor today about infliximab and he said i would be supposed to take it with azathioprine at the same time to make it effective, is your sister on both or just infliximab? i canâ€™t take azathioprine because of last time so thinking of asking to be on skyrizi or stelera!
"my sister is on azathioprine as well as inflixamab to help prevent antibody formation.

i was on azathioprine before starting biologics. i ended up going off the azathioprine after entyvio (my first biologic) started working because the aza was starting to make my white blood cell count drop too low.

during the period where my gi wasn't sure whether skyrizi was helping, we talked about next steps and decided to add azathioprine back in to see if i could tolerate it (with the thought that i would go on inflixamab if skyrizi failed and aza + inflixamab is best practice). i ended up tolerating aza this time around (we started out with a low dose and have been adjusting based on blood tests) and it seems to have helped alongside skyrizi, so i'm staying on the skyrizi + aza combo for now. that combo is pretty rare and most people just use skyrizi by itself.

my gi's other thought was that if i didn't tolerate aza, i could try methotrexate. glad i didn't have to go that route, though."
"my body hates winter. the dry air and the lack of sunlight (at work inside an office during all daylight hours) wreaks havoc on my poor skin. my arms and legs are currently bandaged with tea tree oil on to stop the weeping. i wear clothes that cover everything except my hands and my face when i'm at work so people cant see, and i haven't put my hair up in public since november because my neck is so bad. 

come summer my skin clears and becomes amazing (aka normal). my stepdad says it's because of my indian genetics and my skin cant tolerate english winter lol"
"winters are horrible for me because of the dry air, but summers are just as bad since my skin doesn't like the sun... but i'm happy for you that your skin seems to clear because of the sun!

just a quick question, if you don't mind... isn't the whole idea behind a placebo that the patients themselves don't knew they get the placebo?"
"if you know it's a placebo then it isn't much if a placebo..


are you sure you're not on the real thing?"
mine gets better in the sun because of all the vitamin d.
my daughter has flare ups in the summer and winter, but her winter ones are worse by far.  she has red, itchy spots around her eyes right now that she never gets in summer.  we live in texas, so it gets hot here and she's only able to get outside in the morning.  part of the issue we have in summer is that she loves to swim and i think the chlorine pool irritates her skin even though we wash her off immediately and moisturize.  i'm also curious if her sunscreen makes things work.
rinvoq is amazing. best of luck! been on it almost two years now. put me in remission very quickly.
definitely. i may have a few patches, but in the summer i have almost no problems. i can use heavily scented soaps, swim, etc. i always get complimented about how beautiful my skin is in the summer too and iâ€™m like you dont even knooww.
winters are definitely worse than summers for me.
